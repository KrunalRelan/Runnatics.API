### 2026-06-20 — PART 2: one-button "Save & Process Result" on manual-time edit — Opus EXECUTE

**Goal:** editing a manual time should save AND recompute the participant + re-rank the race in one action, without a separate Process Result click. **Research finding (decisive):** `RecordManualTimeAsync` (the `addManualTime` PUT) ALREADY recomputes this participant's RN/SplitTimes/Results from the new ChipTime and calls `CalculateResultRankingsAsync` (re-ranks the WHOLE race overall/gender/category) — all inside ONE transaction in ONE request. So the per-participant recompute + whole-race re-rank is already atomic; no second call needed → both prior bugs (NoTracking double-attach, "second operation on this context") are avoided by construction. Chaining the full `ProcessParticipantResultAsync` (→ `ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync`, re-normalize from raw) was REJECTED: it always writes `IsManualEntry=false` (RFIDImportService.cs:2198) and, where a raw read also exists at the checkpoint, would add a competing automatic `ReadNormalized` that `LoadCheckpointTimesAsync` (picks `OrderBy(ChipTime).First()`) could surface over the manual time — i.e. clobber risk + heavier. **User-confirmed:** Option A (in-save recalc), keep the header Process Result button (it serves the race-move/category edit form + manual reprocess-from-raw). **Changes:** (API) `RecordManualTimeAsync` now calls `CalculateResultRankingsAsync` UNCONDITIONALLY (was gated on `Finished`) so a manual edit that flips a runner Finished↔DNF re-ranks the whole race and closes/opens the gap — the ranker re-ranks only the Finished set via BulkUpdate, correct+cheap regardless. (UI) manual-time row ✓ relabeled "Save & Process Result"; success snackbar says "Result recalculated and race re-ranked." The row already chained save→server recalc/re-rank→refresh; no second request added. **Files:** `ResultsService.cs` (API); `ParticipantDetail.tsx` (UI). Builds ✅ API+UI, tests ✅ 19/19. **Test target:** edit a manual time on race 49 → one click → time saves + result/ranks update, whole race re-ranks (not just the one runner).

### 2026-06-20 — Split Times & Checkpoint Analysis: 3 fixes (child rows / manual-time TZ / manual-time 500) — Opus EXECUTE

**Target:** participant Split Times & Checkpoint Analysis screen, 7th GGHM (EventId 30; 21.1 Km = RaceId 47; race enc `K_h0cSgS23MmRFBkJhs3Kg`). Three separable issues. Prod facts confirmed via sqlcmd: `Event.TimeZone='Asia/Kolkata'` (NOT "UTC" as the brief assumed → no TZ data-fix needed); Race 47 `StartTime='2026-05-09 23:59:00'` (near-midnight gun → crossings land on May 10, hence the editor needs a DATE); ReadNormalized.ChipTime is a stored UTC instant and `GunTime = ChipTime − StartTime` (verified: ChipTime `2026-05-10 03:09:15` → GunTime 11,415,566 ms).

**ISSUE 1 — child checkpoints rendered as blank "-" rows (API, display-only).** Root cause: `ResultsService.LoadCheckpointTimesAsync` (`:948`) returned EVERY active checkpoint incl. child/paired-reader ones. Discriminator (authoritative, used in `RFIDImportService.cs:1824/2358`, `CheckpointsService.cs:530`): child ⇔ `ParentDeviceId > 0`; parent ⇔ `ParentDeviceId == null || == 0`. **Verified in DB** for event 30: every named checkpoint has `ParentDeviceId NULL`, every unnamed child has it set (no real checkpoint would be wrongly hidden). Fix: added `(c.ParentDeviceId == null || c.ParentDeviceId == 0)` to the query. `LoadCheckpointTimesAsync` is private, single caller (`:896`, builds `response.CheckpointTimes`), downstream of ranking — display only, no timing/normalization impact.

**ISSUE 3 — manual-time save 500 "SplitTimes … already being tracked" (API; same NoTracking family as race-move).** Root cause: in `RecordManualTimeAsync` STEP C attaches `existingSplit` (`CheckpointId==X`, `:1705`); STEP D then loads `nextSplit` (`FromCheckpointId==X`, `:1733`) and attaches it (`:1744`). Since rows have `CheckpointId==ToCheckpointId` and the START row is created with `FromCheckpointId==CheckpointId` (`RFIDImportService.cs:4724`), editing the start checkpoint makes STEP D re-return the SAME row already attached → duplicate-key throw (nondeterministic via unordered `FirstOrDefault`). **Audited the whole txn: this is the SOLE second-attach** — RN/Results/Participant each attach once; the only downstream recompute `CalculateResultRankingsAsync` (`:1750`) touches Results only via `BulkUpdateAsync` (tracker-bypass); the SplitTimes-attaching sibling `CalculateSplitTimeRankingsAsync` is NOT called from this path (only `:237`). `SaveChanges` alone wouldn't fix it (EF keeps rows tracked; the filter still matches). Fix (dedupe-by-identity, invariant option c): STEP D query excludes the edited row (`s.CheckpointId != decryptedCheckpointId`) + guard `nextSplit.Id != existingSplit?.Id`. No `AsNoTracking` added to a read-then-write path.

**ISSUE 2 — manual editor: show DATE + correct IST↔UTC round-trip (API + UI).** Two bugs: (a) manual save set `ReadNormalized.ChipTime = DateTime.UtcNow` (`:1608/:1620`) — the edit moment, not the crossing — so the table (which displays `ChipTime` UTC→event-TZ at `LoadCheckpointTimesAsync:1008`) showed garbage; (b) UI sent `finishTimeMs`=ms-from-midnight and the API treated it as elapsed-from-gun with no TZ conversion. Fix makes manual entry symmetric with automatic reads, keyed on `Event.TimeZone` (same source as display & `RFIDImportService.ParseSqliteFileAsync:1701`):
- **API:** `ManualTimeRequest` — added `string? CrossingLocalDateTime` (event-local wall clock, no offset), made `FinishTimeMs` nullable/optional (deprecated fallback). `IResultsService`/controller updated. `RecordManualTimeAsync` now loads `Event.TimeZone` (try/catch IST fallback), computes `crossingUtc` (local→UTC via event TZ) + `chipTimeMs = crossingUtc − raceStartUtc`, and stores `ChipTime = crossingUtc` at both RN sites. Legacy `finishTimeMs` paths retained (now also use `Event.TimeZone` instead of hardcoded IST). Display round-trips automatically once ChipTime is the real instant.
- **UI (`Runnatics.UI`):** `RFIDService.addManualTime` sends `crossingLocalDateTime` (no client-side TZ math). `ParticipantDetail.tsx` editor → `type="datetime-local"` (`step:1`), `handleStartEdit` defaults via `toLocalDateTimeInput(participant.startTime, currentTime)` (race-start local date + existing time-of-day; admin adjusts).

**Files:** API — `ResultsService.cs` (3 issues), `ManualTimeRequest.cs`, `IResultsService.cs`, `RFIDController.cs`. UI — `RFIDService.ts`, `ParticipantDetail.tsx`. **Builds:** Services ✅, full solution ✅ 0 errors, UI `npm run build` ✅. **Tests:** Services ✅ 19/19 (`DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor`). **No SQL / no schema change.**

**Prod verify (after deploy):** (1) 21.1K participant detail → child "-" rows gone, only named checkpoints show. (2) Edit a manual time with a date+time → table shows the entered IST time-of-day (not the edit moment); stored `ChipTime` UTC = entered IST − 5:30. (3) Edit the **Start** checkpoint manual time → no 500. **Note:** Race 47 `StartTime` 23:59 placeholder is the pre-existing day/gun-config quirk (see 2026-06-16 entry) — out of scope here; elapsed-from-gun depends on it being correct.

**Follow-up 2 (same session) — manual-time editor defaulted to the WRONG DAY → negative chipTime (Opus EXECUTE).** Prod test (deployed Issue-2 fix): editing Start showed `2026-05-09 05:51:31` and save failed `Calculated chip time -85049000ms is invalid`. Root cause in the Issue-2 UI: the datetime-local default took its DATE from `participant.startTime` (= `Race.StartTime`, the day-early `2026-05-09 23:59` placeholder) and its TIME from the split's IST display — two sources, and `Race.StartTime` serializes kind-less (`"2026-05-09T23:59:00"`, no `Z`) so `new Date()` parsed it as browser-local → locked to May 9. Math confirms: editor `2026-05-09T05:51:31` IST → UTC `2026-05-09 00:21:31` − DB StartTime `2026-05-09 23:59:00` = −85,049,000 ms (exact). The crossing's real date (May 10, ~06:00 IST) was never consulted — the UI had no field carrying it (`CheckpointTimeInfo.Time` is time-only). **Fix:** API adds `CheckpointTimeInfo.LocalDateTime` (event-local `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`, from the reading's ChipTime→IST already computed for `Time`; null if not crossed). UI editor pre-fills DATE+time from `checkpointTime.localDateTime` (no browser Date parsing); fallback borrows the crossing date from any sibling checkpoint + this row's time-of-day, else today; removed `participant.startTime` as the date source. The negative-chipTime guard stays as the safety net. Files: `CheckpointTimeInfo.cs`, `ResultsService.cs` (API); `CheckpointTime.ts`, `ParticipantDetail.tsx` (UI). Builds ✅ API+UI, tests ✅ 19/19. **Still pending — PART 2: consolidate to one "Save & Process Result" action** (auto per-participant recalc + race re-rank after a manual-time save, sequenced after commit on a clean context). NOT started — gated on user verifying the date round-trip first. **Reminder:** Race 47 StartTime is the day-early `23:59` placeholder (~31 min before the real `2026-05-10 00:30 UTC` gun) — chipTime is now positive but its magnitude stays offset until that data is corrected (pre-existing, separate).

**Follow-up (same session) — "second operation started on this context" after the Issue-3 fix (Opus EXECUTE).** Once Issue 3 stopped the Start-checkpoint edit throwing at STEP D, execution reached the `computedStatus == Finished` branch (editing Start can complete the last missing mandatory distance) and surfaced a **pre-existing** DbContext concurrency bug: `_ = Task.Run(() => _raceNotificationService.NotifyRaceCompletionAsync(...))` (~`:1815`) ran on a background thread while `_raceNotificationService` shares THIS request's scoped `IUnitOfWork<RaceSyncDbContext>` (RaceNotificationService.cs:12) and immediately issues a DB read (`LoadParticipantAsync`). That raced the awaited `updatedResult`/`count` reads right after it on the same context → "A second operation was started on this context instance." (Also latent: the request context is disposed at end-of-request, so the fire-and-forget could hit a disposed context.) **Audit:** every other DB call in `RecordManualTimeAsync` (incl. the new TZ-resolution query, both ChipTime write sites, STEP D) is awaited and sequential; this `Task.Run` is the only overlap, and the only one in the whole file. **Fix:** inject `IServiceScopeFactory`; the fire-and-forget now creates its OWN scope, resolves a fresh `IRaceNotificationService` (own DbContext), and is wrapped in try/catch with logging. Removed the now-unused `_raceNotificationService` field/ctor param (resolved per-call from scope). Build ✅ 0 errors, full solution ✅, tests ✅ 19/19.

### 2026-06-16 — Race 49 (5 Km) blank splits / rank #0 for moved runners — DIAGNOSIS (Opus; data-fix handoff, no code change)

**Symptom:** moved/late-added runners in **RaceId 49** (event 30, title "5 Km") show blank Split Times + rank #0. Reported via encrypted participant `364YW9nVJ_mxs1DCS4bCFQ` (= **ParticipantId 25590, bib 1012, Deepika Dalal**) and encrypted race `dwNcr4cQCwLRDfTvAIWkYA` (= **RaceId 49**). UI "RFID Tag Readings: 17 total · 0 normalized · 14 unassigned".

**ID note:** prod `Encryption:Key` (Azure env var) ≠ local user-secrets key, so prod encrypted IDs do NOT decrypt locally (AES-CBC, key=SHA256(key), iv=SHA256(key+"_iv")[..16], base64url, in `EncryptionService.cs`). Resolved the participant/race by DB fingerprint instead. DB read access: `sqlcmd` + connection string from user-secrets `add88346-…`.

**Root cause = day-early `Races.StartTime` for RaceId 49** (`2026-05-08 23:59:00`; real gun was night of `2026-05-09`, earliest start-mat read `2026-05-09 23:58:50.798`). The Phase 2 guard `RFIDImportService.cs:1983` (`daysDiff = |StartTime − earliestReading| > 1` ⇒ abort whole Phase 2) is evaluated over the **post-exclusion `rawReadings`** set (excludes already-normalized via event-wide `existingNormalizedReadIds`, line 1862/1957). Original full run normalized 258/318 because the field's earliest read was 0.99988 d (10 s under). The **6** movers/late-adds processed in a later incremental run (bibs 2295,2283,1069,**1012 Deepika**,1173 Hansraj=prev mover,1256) have earliest remaining read `2026-05-09 23:59:57.806` = **1.00067 d — 58 s over** ⇒ guard aborts ⇒ 0 ReadNormalized ⇒ blank splits, Registered-only.

**Ruled out:** (X) incomplete assignment — the 14 "unassigned" are correct: dedup losers (rapid repeats at one mat) + off-course-device reads (`809d`/`ebed` are NOT race-49 checkpoints; race 49 loops Start=Finish on mat `ebf3`, 2.5 Km on `ebeb`). The 3 reads on race-49 devices assigned correctly (Start 321, 2.5Km 322, Finish 324). (Contamination) — a `2026-01-25` read I surfaced was a **false alarm from my own query** that joined reads by EPC WITHOUT Phase 2's batch/event scope; the faithful reproduction (batch `EventId=30`, `RaceId=49|NULL`) shows 34 reads, 0 outside May. Phase 2 IS event/batch-scoped, so cross-event reused-chip reads never enter the set.

**Fix (data + reprocess; handed to user for manual run — no repo code change):**
1. `UPDATE Races SET StartTime='2026-05-09 23:59:00' WHERE Id=49 AND StartTime='2026-05-08 23:59:00';` (off-by-one-day correction; ≤a few min around 23:58 all work — pre-gun start crossings handled by BUG-27 clamp; negative-GunTime gate `:2470` only checks FINISH reads, so a ~10 s pre-gun start read is safe).
2. Full force-reprocess: `POST /api/RFID/{encEvent30}/dwNcr4cQCwLRDfTvAIWkYA/process-all?forceReprocess=true` (Clear+rebuild) — rebuilds all 318 incl. the 258's currently ~24 h-inflated GunTimes (NetTimes were always correct — from each runner's own start-mat crossing).
3. Verify: 6 runners (25555,25543,25647,25590,25751,26299) get NormCount>0 + ranked; Deepika finish GunTime ~5.55M ms (~1h32m) not ~92M ms (~25h).

**⚠️ Latent (NOT fixed, user deferred):** the `daysDiff` guard is **order-dependent** — same data passes on a full run but fails on incremental reprocess of movers (10 s-under vs 58 s-over margins). Correcting StartTime resolves this incident; the fragility (guard comparing post-exclusion MIN, fires inconsistently when StartTime drifts within a day) remains for any future race. Same wafer-thin margin flagged in the 2026-06-14 entry below. Consider comparing against the race's overall earliest reading or a non-fatal per-participant clamp — separate pass.

### 2026-06-14 — Process-result "Phase 2 failed: Deduplication error" — surfaced the real reason (Opus; diagnosis + wrapper hygiene)

**Symptom:** `process-result` on the 5K (RaceId 49) for a moved runner (ParticipantId 25751 — bib 1173 is REUSED across 18 races, so key on ParticipantId, see [[project_bib_not_unique]]) returned 400 `"Phase 2 failed: Deduplication error"`.

**Diagnosis (DB queries against 25751 + schema from EF configs — RawRFIDReadings has NO EventId/ParticipantId; link is `Epc → Chips.EPC → ChipAssignments.ChipId{ParticipantId}`):**
- The move's Save step (commit `a11e94d`) **worked perfectly**: 7 reads reset to `Pending`, 0 checkpoint assignments, 0 leftover ReadNormalized. Vindicated.
- Killed every code-line hypothesis: `:1898` ToDictionary collision = 0 **DB-GLOBAL** (the query must be global — `activeAssignments` at `:1888` has NO event/race filter); `Race.StartTime` not null; no leftover ReadNormalized.
- `"Phase 2 failed: Deduplication error"` has ONE source — the wrapper `RFIDImportService.cs:1558`, fired on `dedupeResponse.Status=="Failed"` **regardless of exception**. The catch at `:2293` logs `"Error during deduplication and normalization"` (NOT `"Error during deduplication:"` — that string is only the un-logged `ErrorMessage` property; a search for it gives a false "no log").
- `DeduplicateAndNormalizeAsync` controlled-fail branches: `:1764` race-null, `:1776` StartTime-null, `:1978` `daysDiff>1`, `:1988` `minutesDiff<-60`. Per data, **none fire**: Race 49 StartTime `2026-05-08 23:59`, earliest read `2026-05-09 23:56` → `daysDiff=0.9982` (misses `>1` by 2.6 min), `minutesDiff=+1437`. So it's a **real throw** (catch `:2293`) the wrong-string log search missed — OR a stale observation.

**Real config bug found (fix outside code):** `Race 49.StartTime` is **a day early** (reads are ~1 day after) → produces ~24h GunTimes. The `:1978` guard was meant to catch exactly this but misses by 2.6 min. Correct the StartTime to the real gun (just before `2026-05-09 23:56`).

**Change (`RFIDImportService.cs`, `ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync`):** the 4 phase wrappers (`:1507` P1, `:1558` P2, `:1585` P2.5, `:1609` P3) now **surface the captured `ErrorMessage`** (old generic string as fallback) instead of hiding it. The 400 body now states the real reason (e.g. the actual exception, or `"Race.StartTime … is more than 1 hour AFTER the earliest reading"`). Build ✅ 0 errors, tests ✅ 19/19.

**Next:** deploy + fix Race 49 StartTime + re-run process-result → it succeeds or the 400 now names the exact cause.

### 2026-06-14 — Auto-process on participant-edit Save (UI repo `Runnatics.Ui`, commit `3b13fcc`) — Opus EXECUTE

**Why:** the race-move now rebuilds correctly on Process Result, so the manual "go to the other race and click Process" step is removed. The edit dialog (`EditParticipant.tsx`) detects what changed and chains the right follow-up sequentially after Save commits.

**Case mapping (race change takes precedence — full process covers a category change too):**
- **Race changed →** `POST participants/{eventId}/{targetRaceId}/{participantId}/process-result` = full `ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync` rebuild on the TARGET race. Button "Save & Process Result".
- **AgeCategory changed (same race) →** `PUT participants/{eventId}/{raceId}/{participantId}/race-category` = cheap whole-race re-rank (`ChangeParticipantCategoryAsync` → `CalculateResultRankingsAsync`; re-ranks EVERY category bucket, so the bucket left AND joined both correct; NO Phase 1/1.5/2, readings untouched). Button "Save & Re-rank". Also closes the latent stale-category-rank gap (edit-form same-race path never re-ranked before).
- **Scalar only →** plain Save. Button "Update Participant".

**Wiring:** strictly sequential (await Save commit → THEN follow-up; never parallel). Save fails → no follow-up, show save error. Save ok but follow-up fails → recoverable `warning` Alert + **Retry** (re-fires ONLY the follow-up; runner is saved + re-processable), not a red error. Dynamic button label + combined progress (Saving… → Processing…/Re-ranking…).

**No API change** — `process-result` already runs the full workflow (commit `a11e94d`); the `race-category` endpoint already existed and re-ranks the whole race.

**UI plumbing (same bug class as BUG-B):** `ServiceUrls.changeRaceCategory` had the WRONG route (`participants/${participantId}/race-category` — missing `eventId/raceId`); corrected to `participants/${eventId}/${raceId}/${participantId}/race-category` (verified against the `[HttpPut("{eventId}/{raceId}/{participantId}/race-category")]` attribute). Added `ParticipantService.changeRaceCategory(eventId, raceId, participantId, ageCategory)` (`PUT` body `{ ageCategory }`).

**Build:** UI ✅ 0 errors (`vite build`), type-check clean. **Files:** `models/ServiceUrls.ts`, `services/ParticipantService.ts`, `pages/admin/participants/EditParticipant.tsx`.

### 2026-06-14 — Race-move SHARED-COURSE correction: delete-to-DNS → re-project from raw (Opus EXECUTE; supersedes the consolidation refactor's DNS model)

**Why:** the consolidation refactor (below) assumed a cross-distance move leaves the runner with "no target detections → DNS". WRONG for this **shared-course** event: all distances start together and run the same physical route to their split point, crossing the **same physical mats**. A physical crossing is stored **once** and is race-independent; which race it projects into is decided at processing time via EPC→Participant→**current** `RaceId`. So a 21.1K runner moved to the 5K HAS real crossings at the 5K's mats → must get a **real** result, never a forced DNS. Correct model: a move is **"re-register + reprocess from raw against the new race"**, reusing the proven pipeline — not a bespoke move-time mapper, and not delete-to-DNS.

**Data-model facts CORRECTED (supersede the entry below):**
- **`ReadRaw` is a DEAD table** — nothing writes it (only the config registration). The live raw layer is **`RawRFIDReading`** (`BatchId`,`DeviceId`,`Epc`,`TimestampMs`,`ReadTimeUtc`,`ProcessResult`). `ReadNormalized.RawReadId` is declared FK→`ReadRaw` but is populated with `RawRFIDReading.Id` (`RFIDImportService.cs:1959,2189`). The move must **retain `RawRFIDReading`** (the earlier "retain ReadRaw audit trail" gate checked the wrong table).
- **Event-level uploads** (`UploadBatch.RaceId = NULL`, the confirmed mode here) are visible to every race's processing (`b.RaceId == target || b.RaceId == null`). Re-normalizing a moved runner against the target picks up their shared-mat reads automatically once `Participant.RaceId = target`.
- **`ChipAssignment`** PK `(EventId,ParticipantId,ChipId)` — participant-scoped, no RaceId → EPC→Participant resolves unchanged after the move.

**The three gates a cross-race move must clear (and why Process Result = the full workflow):**
- (a) EPC→Participant by RaceId — auto once `Participant.RaceId=target`. ✅
- (b) Phase 2 SKIPS already-normalized reads (`existingNormalizedReadIds`, event-wide) → must **hard-delete the participant's `ReadNormalized`** so their reads are re-eligible.
- (c) Phase 1 SKIPS reads with an active `ReadingCheckpointAssignment` and Phase 2's `ToDictionary(ReadingId)` collides on a stale one → must **hard-delete the participant's `ReadingCheckpointAssignment`**.
- **Simple-race trap:** Phase 1 loads `ProcessResult=="Pending"` only, and Phase 1.5 (shared-device assigner) **early-returns for simple linear races** (no device shared across ≥2 checkpoints). After a race is timed the reads are `"Success"`, so a move into a SIMPLE target race would re-assign **nothing** → false DNS. Fix: **reset the participant's `RawRFIDReading.ProcessResult = "Pending"`** at Save so Phase 1 reloads & re-assigns them.

**⚠️ DEPENDENCY (make visible):** the reset-to-Pending works because **EVENT-LEVEL uploads keep their batches perpetually `"uploaded"`** (set at parse time `RFIDImportService.cs:763`; Phase 1 marks ONLY race-level batches `"completed"`, never event-level), so Phase 1's batch gate always includes them and a per-reading reset suffices (no batch flip). **If a future event uses RACE-LEVEL uploads** (those batches DO get `"completed"`, and `ClearProcessedData` never resets event-level batches), this reset-to-Pending path must be revisited.

**Changes:**
- **`ParticipantImportService.MoveParticipantToRaceAsync`** (Save, one transaction, all participant-scoped via EPC→event reads): (1) move registration on the same row; (2) **reset this participant's `RawRFIDReading`→Pending** (clear `ProcessedAt`/`AssignmentMethod`/`Notes`, `BulkUpdateAsync`); (2b) **hard-delete their `ReadingCheckpointAssignment`** (`BulkDeleteAsync`); (3) **hard-delete their `Results`/`SplitTimes`/`ReadNormalized`**; retain `RawRFIDReading`; (5) re-rank **source** via `ReRankRaceAsync` (bulk, no `Include`). EPC scope starts from this participant's `ChipAssignment` rows → no other participant's reads touched.
- **`ResultsService.ProcessParticipantResultAsync`** now injects **`IRFIDImportService`** (cycle-free — RFID svc has no `IResultsService` dep) and runs **`ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync(event, race)`** (Phase 1→1.5→2→2.5→3) before the per-participant status confirm. This rebuilds the moved runner's timing from raw; idempotent for everyone else (skip-guards leave still-`Success`/still-normalized runners untouched). Runs on a **fresh request scope** (process-result is a separate HTTP request from the edit/save), so no collision with the move transaction under the global NoTracking default. Workflow `Status=="Failed"` → `ErrorMessage` + return false (recoverable: admin re-hits Process Result; raw retained).

**Outcomes (acceptance matrix — user walks in prod):** 21.1K→5K full-course → real 5K finish; 5K→21.1K ran-only-5K → DNF (missing later mandatory); 5K→21.1K actually-ran-21.1K → full finish; true no-show → DNS (natural); **SIMPLE linear target → real result, NOT DNS** (the reset-to-Pending case).

**Build:** ✅ 0 errors (solution). **Tests:** Services ✅ 19/19. A move integration test was **not feasible** in the current harness (pure-algorithm tests only; `BulkUpdate/BulkDelete` need a real relational provider — EF in-memory can't exercise them). **Supersedes** the delete-to-DNS model and the "retain ReadRaw" gate in the entry directly below.

### 2026-06-14 — Race-move CONSOLIDATION REFACTOR (the real fix; replaces the 3-patch saga) — Opus EXECUTE

**Why:** three patches to `MigrateParticipantToRaceAsync` each exposed the next layer (tracking 500 → SaveChanges flush → `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` "expected 1 row, affected 0"). Root model was wrong: the method **reassigned derived/normalized timing in place across races** (`UPDATE Results.RaceId`, `UPDATE ReadNormalized.CheckpointId+ParticipantId`, soft-delete SplitTimes). A 21.1K finisher's 9 detections / 8 splits live at 5/10/15/21 km mats that **don't exist on a 5K** — carrying them is garbage AND the phantom-PK 0-rows source. No concurrency token exists anywhere (verified), so 0-rows = PK-absent at write time, not a token mismatch. `BulkUpdate` would have HIDDEN the 0-rows and persisted corrupt data — explicitly rejected.

**Data-model facts established:** `ReadNormalized` is **race-bound** (no `RaceId` column; bound via `CheckpointId`→race-specific `Checkpoint` + race-relative Gun/Net times; `RawReadId`→`ReadRaw`). `ReadRaw` (EPC/reader/timestamp) is the **immutable physical-detection audit trail**, NOT participant-keyed; `ReadNormalized.RawReadId→ReadRaw` is `OnDelete:SetNull`, so deleting `ReadNormalized` never touches `ReadRaw` (confirmed before deleting). `Results↔Participant` is 1:1 with a UNIQUE `Results.ParticipantId` index.

**Refactor (`ParticipantImportService.cs` only):**
- `MigrateParticipantToRaceAsync` → **`MoveParticipantToRaceAsync`** (runtime move, not an EF migration; old name violated no-migrations convention + misled debugging). Both callers renamed (`EditParticipant`, `UpdateParticipantExtendedAsync`).
- **SAVE (one transaction):** move registration on the **same Participant row** (`RaceId=target`, `Status="Registered"`, audit); **HARD-DELETE** this participant's `Results`/`SplitTimes`/`ReadNormalized` via `BulkDeleteAsync` (retain `ReadRaw`); `ChipAssignment` untouched (same row); re-rank **source race only**. No cross-race reassignment, no new participant row, **no inline target reprocess**.
- `RecalculateRaceRanksAsync` → **`ReRankRaceAsync`**: dropped `.Include(Participant)` (no graph cascade), projects gender/category via dict, writes via `BulkUpdateAsync`.
- Removed now-unused `IServiceScopeFactory` injection + DI using (the `afe3cbe` inline reprocess is gone).
- **PROCESS RESULT unchanged** — owns the target rebuild (fresh context). Cross-distance move → participant has no target detections → DNS (correct) until manual time.

**Why the failure class is gone:** only ONE tracked entity (participant) per transaction (everything else bulk) → no NoTracking double-attach; derived rows deleted not re-read-then-written → no phantom-PK 0-rows; derived data never carried across layouts → no corrupt 21km-on-5K data.

**Build:** ✅ 0 errors. **Tests:** Services ✅ 19/19.
**Prod verify (bib 2148, 21.1K→5K):** Save → Registered/DNS in 5K, source 21.1K re-ranked without them, no 500, no 0-rows, `ReadRaw` retained.
**Booked follow-up:** same-distance move should re-normalize from retained `ReadRaw` instead of delete-to-DNS.
**Supersedes:** the BUG A `afe3cbe` (fresh-scope) + `d43d59b` (SaveChanges flush) patches — both targeted symptoms of this wrong model.

### 2026-06-14 — BUG B (process-result 404) — DONE (UI repo)

- **Symptom:** `POST /api/Results/{eventId}/{raceId}/participant/{participantId}/process-result` → 404 from the participant detail page.
- **Root cause:** the endpoint lives on `ParticipantsController` (`api/Participants/{eventId}/{raceId}/{participantId}/process-result`, `ParticipantsController.cs:609`), NOT `ResultsController`. The FE URL had the wrong controller prefix (`Results`) AND an extra `participant/` path segment → no route match → 404. Backend endpoint + `ProcessParticipantResultAsync` were correct; no API change needed.
- **Fix (UI repo `C:\Projects\Runnatics.UI\Runnatics.Ui`, commit `c1b0cc8`):** `src/main/src/models/ServiceUrls.ts:47` `processParticipantResult` → `` `participants/${eventId}/${raceId}/${participantId}/process-result` `` (matches the sibling `getParticipantDetections` pattern). `npm run build` (Vite) ✅.

### 🏛️ INVARIANT — global `QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking` (Program.cs:100)

`AddDbContextPool<RaceSyncDbContext>` sets `options.UseQueryTrackingBehavior(QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking)`. **Consequence:** every `GetQuery` (raw `_dbSet`, no `.AsTracking()`) returns a **FRESH untracked instance with NO identity resolution**. Re-querying the same row in one unit of work yields a DIFFERENT object with the same key.
- `UpdateAsync`/`UpdateRangeAsync` call `_dbSet.Update(...)` which **attaches**. If the SAME Id is loaded twice and both are attached, EF throws "another instance with the same key value for {'Id'} is already being tracked".
- **Rule:** when two write paths can touch the same Id within one transaction, either (a) `SaveChangesAsync()` between them (flush so a later read sees the new state / no longer matches), or (b) use bulk ops (`BulkUpdateAsync` bypasses the tracker), or (c) dedupe by Id before attaching. Do NOT assume identity resolution protects you — it does NOT in this codebase. (Same family as the enum-vs-DB-string bugs: an assumption that's silently false here.)

### 2026-06-14 — BUG A (edit-participant 500: EF Results double-attach on race-move) — Opus EXECUTE (CORRECTED root cause + real fix)

**Symptom:** `PUT /api/participants/{id}/edit-participant` → 500 when moving a runner to a different race. Error: "The instance of entity type 'Results' cannot be tracked because another instance with the same key value for {'Id'} is already being tracked." **Deterministic, FINISHERS ONLY** (repro: bib 2148, a 21.1K finisher, → 5K).

**REAL root cause (corrected — see NoTracking invariant above):** inside `MigrateParticipantToRaceAsync`'s transaction, the moved participant's `Results` row is attached TWICE:
1. `:2394` `oldResults` loaded NoTracking (fresh instance, Id=N) → reassigned → `:2409` `UpdateRangeAsync` **attaches** Id=N.
2. No SaveChanges yet → DB row still shows SOURCE race. `:2481` `RecalculateRaceRanksAsync(sourceRaceId)` re-queries the source race filtered `Status=="Finished"` (`:2504`, NoTracking → a SECOND fresh instance, same Id=N) → `:2545` `UpdateRangeAsync` tries to attach Id=N → **THROW**.
- Finisher-only because the rank query filters `Status=="Finished"`; a DNF/DNS row isn't returned, so it's attached only once.

**Why the earlier `afe3cbe` fresh-scope fix did NOT fix it:** the throw is INSIDE the migration transaction, BEFORE the post-commit reprocess that `afe3cbe` isolated. And that reprocess (`CalculateRaceResultsAsync`) writes only via `BulkInsert/BulkUpdate` which BYPASS the tracker — it was never the thrower. (The original research mis-assumed identity resolution; the global NoTracking default inverts that. `afe3cbe` is harmless/defensible isolation but targeted an already-safe path.)

**FIX (approved):** added `await _repository.SaveChangesAsync();` after the reassignment block (after chip-assignment UpdateRange, `~2477`) and BEFORE `RecalculateRaceRanksAsync` (`~2481`), still INSIDE `ExecuteInTransactionAsync` (flush, not commit → atomicity preserved; precedent at `:2387`). Once `RaceId=target` is flushed, the source-race rank query no longer returns the row → no second instance. **Bonus correctness fix:** the moved finisher is no longer re-ranked back into the race it's leaving.
- Did NOT add `AsNoTracking` anywhere (already the global default; the read-then-write paths rely on the attach).
- **Source race** re-ranks WITHOUT the moved runner (gap closed). **Target race** is re-ranked by the awaited post-commit `CalculateRaceResultsAsync(targetRace)` (fresh scope, sets Overall/Gender/Category ranks) — no stale/missing rank after Save.

**Duplicate-Results guard (already done in `afe3cbe`, confirmed present):** `RFIDImportService.CalculateRaceResultsAsync:2549-2561` dedupes `existingResults` by ParticipantId (keep highest Id + warn) instead of `ToDictionaryAsync` → no duplicate-key `ArgumentException` in the target-race reprocess.

**Build:** `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors. **Tests:** Services ✅ 19/19 (`DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor` for net8.0).
**Files modified this pass:** `Runnatics.Services/ParticipantImportService.cs` (SaveChanges before source re-rank). (`afe3cbe` already shipped the fresh-scope isolation + dedupe guard.)
**Prod verify (after deploy):** move bib 2148 (21.1K → 5K) via the **Race** dropdown → confirm no 500, source (21.1K) re-ranked without them, target (5K) ranks them in.

**Problem 2 (UI, "process-then-save doesn't move runner") — ✅ RESOLVED, NOT a bug (user-confirmed 2026-06-14).** User verified in the network tab: changing the **Race** dropdown DOES send the target 5K id in the PUT `raceId`. The earlier payload (`category:"18 to 30"` changed, `raceId` unchanged) was the admin changing the **Category** dropdown — which relabels the age bracket within the SAME race and never triggers a move. `ParticipantDetail.tsx` race-move binding is correct (`handleRaceIdChange → confirm → setEditRaceId → raceId:editRaceId`). No UI change needed. (UX note for the future refactor: Category vs Race dropdowns are easy to confuse — consider clearer labeling/separation.)

**📌 BOOKED (separate session) — race-move/category-change consolidation refactor.** This path has now produced 5 distinct bugs. Target model: on **Save** = move registration + invalidate derived data; on **Process Result** = recompute splits/results + re-rank BOTH races; derived data always rebuilt, never carried across races. Settle first: is `ReadNormalized` keyed by RaceId or by EPC+Event (decides whether "move the readings" is real work or a reprocess no-op). Do NOT fold into a bugfix — dedicated pass.

(BUG B — process-result 404 — ✅ DONE, UI repo `c1b0cc8`; see entry above.)

### 2026-06-14 — Gender canonicalization (NormalizeGenderForWrite + filter + rank bugs) — Sonnet EXECUTE

**Scope:** Three tightly-scoped fixes in `ParticipantImportService.cs` only.

**PART 1 — `NormalizeGenderForWrite` helper + 4 write sites:**
- Added private static `NormalizeGenderForWrite(string raw)` at line ~1445 (after `MapRaceStatusToDbString`).
  Rule: trim+ToUpperInvariant → "M"/"MALE"→"M", "F"/"FEMALE"→"F", anything else → `raw.Trim()` (pass through).
- Applied at all 4 write sites (lines 315, 773, 838, 1352); the `?? "Unknown"` fallback for null/whitespace is unchanged — only non-empty values are now normalized.
- EF Core `GenderNormalizer` value converter (`ParticipantConfiguration.cs`) left untouched; it remains the safety-net for any path that bypasses these sites.

**PART 2 — `MapGenderToDbString` helper + 2 filter sites:**
- Added private static `MapGenderToDbString(Gender gender)` mirroring `MapRaceStatusToDbString` pattern.
  `Gender.Male→"M"`, `Gender.Female→"F"`, `_→null`.
- Applied at both filter sites:
  - Line ~423: paginated search `if (request.Gender.HasValue)` block (guard `if (genderString != null)` added).
  - Line ~1420: `BuildSearchExpression` predicate (direct substitution).
- **Root cause was identical to BUG-2 status filter:** `Gender enum.ToString()` → `"Male"` ≠ DB `"M"` → filter never matched any rows.

**PART 3 — Fix `RecalculateRaceRanksAsync` gender rank:**
- Line ~2506: changed `new[]{"Male","Female","Others"}` to `new[]{"M","F"}` to match canonical DB values.
- `ResultsService` (lines 1312, 1362) already used `"M"/"F"` correctly; this aligns the only remaining divergent site.

**Pattern note (logged for future):** enum `.ToString()` vs canonical DB string has now bitten us in BUG-2 (status) and here (gender, 3 sites). Any future enum-backed string column comparison MUST use an explicit mapping helper, never `.ToString()`.

**SQL for data cleanup (provide to user for manual run):**
```sql
-- INSPECT first — see what non-canonical values remain
SELECT RaceId, Gender, COUNT(*) AS Cnt
FROM Participants
WHERE IsActive=1 AND IsDeleted=0
  AND Gender NOT IN ('M','F','Unknown')
  AND Gender IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY RaceId, Gender;

-- Fix casing/spelled-out only (Unknown left untouched)
UPDATE Participants SET Gender='M'
WHERE IsActive=1 AND IsDeleted=0
  AND UPPER(LTRIM(RTRIM(Gender))) IN ('M','MALE');
UPDATE Participants SET Gender='F'
WHERE IsActive=1 AND IsDeleted=0
  AND UPPER(LTRIM(RTRIM(Gender))) IN ('F','FEMALE');
```

**Build:** `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors (pre-existing warnings only).
**Tests:** .NET 8 runtime not installed on this machine (only .NET 10) — tests target net8.0 and cannot run. Set `$env:DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD='LatestMajor'` or install .NET 8 runtime to run locally.
**Files modified:** `Runnatics.Services/ParticipantImportService.cs` only.

### 2026-06-13 — BUG-1 (gender reset on save) + BUG-2 (status filter broken) — admin participant screens — Sonnet EXECUTE

- **BUG-1 — Gender lost on ParticipantDetail.tsx inline save:**
  - Root cause: `ParticipantDetail.tsx` edit form had no `editGender` state; `handleSaveEdit` sent no `gender` field → backend coerced missing/null gender to `"Unknown"`. The `EditParticipant.tsx` modal (from ViewParticipants list) was already correct.
  - Fix (`ParticipantDetail.tsx`, UI repo): added `toGenderValue()` helper (same as `EditParticipant.tsx`); added `const [editGender, setEditGender] = useState('')`; populated in populate-useEffect via `setEditGender(toGenderValue(participant.gender || ''))`; added Gender Select (M/F/Other) to edit form; added `gender: editGender || undefined` to `handleSaveEdit` payload.
  - Note: full-name-in-firstName / empty-lastName data issue flagged per user instruction, not fixed (data-import problem).

- **BUG-2 — Status filter returns nothing for "Completed" and "No Show":**
  - Root cause: `ParticipantImportService` at two sites called `.ToString()` on `RaceStatus` enum → `Completed→"Completed"` ≠ DB `"Finished"`, `NoShow→"NoShow"` ≠ DB `"DNS"`. Registered and DNF worked by coincidence (enum names match DB strings).
  - Fix (`ParticipantImportService.cs`): added private static `MapRaceStatusToDbString(RaceStatus)` (`Completed→"Finished"`, `NoShow→"DNS"`, others→name); applied at both filter sites — paginated-search `if (request.Status.HasValue)` block (~line 414) and `BuildSearchExpression` predicate (~line 1418). No enum rename, no DTO change, no SQL.
  - Fix (`ViewParticipants.tsx`): renamed "No Show" MenuItem label to "DNS".
- **Builds:** `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors · `npm run build` ✅ built in ~20s.

### 2026-06-13 — Public Split Details: speed bug + start-row 00:00:00 (BUG-25 display, page-scoped) — Opus EXECUTE

- **Symptom (Bib 2262, RaceId 47):** public Split Details page (`racetik.com/p/{id}` → "Split Details" tab) showed impossible running speeds (30.86 / 43.49 / 64 / 79 / 86 km/h) and a Start row of 00:00:33 — even though the backend `SplitTimes` data was correct (post Clear-gate rebuild).
- **Root cause was BACKEND, not UI** (the brief assumed UI repo): `ParticipantDetailPage.tsx` / `getParticipantDetail` (`Runnatics.UI .../src/api/publicApi.ts`) do **zero** math — they render `split.speed/splitTime/raceTime/splitDist` verbatim. The computation is in `PublicResultsService.GetPublicParticipantDetailAsync`. The speed line divided the **cumulative** `ToCheckpoint.DistanceFromStart` by the **per-segment** `SegmentTime` (`st.Distance` is never populated by the pipeline, so it always fell back to cumulative distance). `cumulativeDist ÷ segmentTime` reproduced every reported number to the decimal.
- **Sweep (user-requested) — the buggy `cumulativeDistance ÷ SegmentTime` formula existed in EXACTLY ONE place.** `ResultsService.RecordManualTimeAsync` (`~1582`) already computed segment speed correctly; `PublicResultsService` avg-pace (`~544/567`) and `ResultsService` (`~167`) are legitimate cumulative-time ÷ cumulative-distance avg pace. 🟡 Noted out-of-scope: `ResultsService.CalculateResultsAsync:167` writes `SplitTimes.Pace` as a *cumulative* avg pace while the manual path writes a *segment* pace — latent pace-semantics inconsistency, tracked separately.
- **Fix (`PublicResultsService.cs`, `GetPublicParticipantDetailAsync` split projection ~584-606; backend-only, no UI/DTO/SQL change):**
  1. **Speed** = `segDist / (SegmentTime / 3_600_000)` where `segDist = thisDist − prevDist` (previous row's `DistanceFromStart`; splits already ordered by distance). Guarded `segDist > 0` and `idx > 0` for the prev-row access.
  2. **Start row** (`DistanceFromStart == 0`) → `SplitTime` = `RaceTime` = `"00:00:00"`, `Speed = null` (renders "—"). Keyed on **distance, not row index**, so a finisher who missed the start mat (first row at >0 km) is NOT wrongly zeroed.
  3. All other rows keep `SegmentTime`/`SplitTimeMs` unchanged.
- **Trace (Bib 2262):** speeds now 17.0 / 16.2 / 13.1 / 18.3 / 15.3 / 15.0 / 14.8 km/h (all ~13–18); Start row 00:00:00 / 00:00:00 / —.
- **Build:** `Runnatics.Services` ✅ 0 errors. **Commit** `f5f148b` (pushed to master). No deploy of UI needed.
- **Scope note:** this is the **page-scoped** BUG-25 display piece (start row = 0). Other BUG-25 surfaces (admin participant detail, leaderboard split view, Excel export, grouped drill-down) remain tracked under BUG-25 (PENDING).

### 2026-06-11 — Post-deploy regression round (ISSUE-1/2/3)

- **ISSUE-3 (gender dropdown resets to "Unknown") — FIXED (UI only).**
  - Root cause: two compounding bugs. (1) `ViewParticipants.normalizeGender` hands the edit dialog **lowercase** `"male"/"female"/"other"`, but `EditParticipant.tsx` Select options were capitalized `"Male"/"Female"/"Other"` → MUI Select rendered empty on load (no matching option). (2) On save, `gender: formData.gender?.trim() || undefined` — when the value was empty/legacy the `gender` key was **omitted** from the request, and backend `EditParticipant` (`ParticipantImportService.cs:837`) coerces a null/blank gender to the literal `"Unknown"`.
  - Fix (`EditParticipant.tsx`): Select option values changed to `value="M"/"F"/"Other"`; added module-level `toGenderValue()` helper that case-insensitively maps `m/male→M`, `f/female→F`, `o/other→Other`, anything else passes through — applied to the form's initial gender (`participant.gender`). Save still sends the raw value; the EF `GenderNormalizer` ValueConverter canonicalizes `M`/`F` on write.
  - Verify: `npm run build` ✅, `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅ exit 0.

- **ISSUE-2 (race move only moves participant data, not timing) — FIXED (backend only).**
  - Root cause: NOT a deploy/trigger bug. The BUG-06 timing migration lived only in `UpdateParticipantExtendedAsync`, but the participant edit form saves through `EditParticipant` (`PUT /api/participants/{participantId}/edit-participant`), whose own divergent race-move branch moved only the participant row + ChipAssignments (never Results/SplitTimes/ReadNormalized).
  - Fix (`ParticipantImportService.cs`): extracted the full BUG-06 migration into a shared private method `MigrateParticipantToRaceAsync(sourceParticipant, targetRaceId)` (returns the new participant, or null + ErrorMessage if target race invalid). Both `UpdateParticipantExtendedAsync` (passes `participant` + request target) and `EditParticipant` (passes `existingParticipant` + `decryptedRaceId` = target) now call it. No code duplication; the two previously-divergent race-move paths are unified.
  - Verify: `dotnet build` (Services + full solution) ✅ 0 errors. No public signatures changed; no SQL.

- **ISSUE-1 (7th GGHM 21KM splits not showing) — ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED + FIXED (N-checkpoint assignment).**
  - **Root cause (user-confirmed via prod DB):** shared-device checkpoint assignment was hardcoded to 2 topologies — `count==1` (single/turnaround) and `count==2` (outbound/return). A device at 3+ sequential course locations (7th GGHM 21KM: Box-1 at 0/10.5/21.1km, Box-6 at 4 locations) matched no branch → `AssignAllCheckpoints` Case 4 drop → no `ReadingCheckpointAssignment` → excluded from normalization (`DeduplicateAndNormalizeAsync` requires an assignment) → zero `ReadNormalized`/`SplitTimes`. Only the one 2-location device (box04) produced normalized reads.
  - **Fix (per approved design doc `.claude/design/ISSUE-1-checkpoint-assignment-redesign.md`):**
    - `LoopRaceCheckpointAssigner.cs`: `SharedDeviceMapping` now holds an ordered `List<CheckpointSlot>` (by `DistanceFromStart`, tiebreak Name→Id) + `AssignmentMode` (`Sequential` = clamp extra passes to last checkpoint; `Cyclic` = pass % N) + `IndexForPass(pass)`. `ReadingInput.IsOutboundOverride (bool?)` → `PassIndexOverride (int?)` (0-based pass ordinal). `IdentifySharedDevices` filters `==2` → `>=2` (primary + child), takes a mode param; child devices inherit the parent's `SharedGroupKey` and identical distance-ordered slot lists. `ResolveOutboundReturn` → `OrderCheckpointsByDistance` (distance authoritative; equal-distance warning kept). `GenerateGroupKey` N-aware (`Start_10.5KM_Finish`). `AssignAllCheckpoints` Case 2: pass ordinal → `Checkpoints[IndexForPass(pass)]`; priority order **PassIndexOverride (production-dominant) → TurnaroundReference (generalized to first/last = legacy outbound/return for N=2) → ChronologicalOrder (rank-1 = pass ordinal)**.
    - `RFIDImportService.cs` (Phase 1.5 only, 4 edits): derive `assignmentMode` from `RaceSettings.HasLoops` (true→Cyclic, else Sequential); pass mode to `IdentifySharedDevices`; precompute `PassIndexOverride = pi` (was `IsOutboundOverride = pi==0`); start-bound collapse check uses `mapping.StartsAtZero`. Pass-gap/dedup loops, Phase 1 deferral, FIX #7 wipe-and-rebuild, Step 5 dedup, Phase 2 all untouched.
  - **Decisions (user-confirmed):** (1) PassIndex dominant, turnaround as retained fallback — matches production B behavior, no regression; (2) Cyclic implemented in assigner, but distinct-checkpoint-rows (`GenerateLoopCheckpoints`) is the SUPPORTED loop pattern — true cyclic reuse collapses laps downstream (Step 5 + Phase 2 keep one reading per participant+checkpoint; `ReadNormalized` has no lap column); (3) unit tests included.
  - **Tests (NEW `Runnatics\tests\Runnatics.Services.Tests\RFID\LoopRaceCheckpointAssignerTests.cs`):** 19 tests, all pass — `IndexForPass` (sequential clamp, cyclic wrap, negative/empty/single edges), `IdentifySharedDevices` (N=1/2/3/4, paired parent+child identical resolution, mode stamping, mixed counts), Topology B regression fixture (PassIndex/clamp/turnaround-fallback/chronological-fallback ≡ legacy outbound/return), Topology C (N=3 ordinal mapping + fewer-passes-than-checkpoints), Cyclic 2-lap wrap.
  - **Builds:** Services ✅ · full solution ✅ · `dotnet test` ✅ 19/19.
  - **Known limitations (documented in design doc §7):** L1 — true cyclic persistence needs lap-discriminated dedup keys + lap column on `ReadNormalized` (future, schema); L2 — a missed read on the SAME device group shifts later pass ordinals (location-blind hardware, monotonic validation can't catch; future expected-time-window mitigation); legacy upload-time path (`ProcessRFIDImportAsync` ~1108-1389, "LoopRaceSequence") left untouched — Phase 1.5 FIX #7 wipes/rebuilds its assignments.
  - **To verify the 7th GGHM fix in prod:** deploy, then re-trigger processing for the 21KM race (Phase 1.5 deletes + recreates all assignments) and confirm `ReadNormalized`/`SplitTimes` populate for all 6 devices. Note prior open item still stands: run the `IsMandatory` schema script if not yet applied (required by `CalculateRaceResultsAsync`).

### 2026-06-12 — BUG-26 (mandatory checkpoint evaluation per-DISTANCE, not per-checkpoint-ID)

- **Rule (user-approved):** mandatory distances = DISTINCT `DistanceFromStart` where any active checkpoint is `IsMandatory`; a distance is SATISFIED if the participant has active `ReadNormalized` at ANY checkpoint at that distance (flagged or not — covers unflagged sibling/child devices); `Finished` = ALL mandatory distances satisfied. Fallback when none flagged: max distance (now distance-based, accepts any device at that distance). Previously `Finished` required a detection at EVERY mandatory checkpoint **ID** → two mandatory devices at the same distance wrongly produced DNF.
- **Fixed in ALL FOUR sites** (research found 2 beyond the reported 2; user approved including them — one rule everywhere):
  1. `RFIDImportService.CalculateRaceResultsAsync` — distance-group build, widened `mandatoryDetections` query, per-distance classification; **finish gate widened** to all checkpoint IDs at the highest mandatory distance, with finish readings collapsed to ONE per participant (earliest GunTime) so ranking/result rows stay unique (status and time come from the same rule).
  2. `ResultsService.ComputeParticipantStatusAsync` — full rewrite to per-distance (loads Id+Distance+IsMandatory in one query).
  3. `ResultsService.RecordManualTimeAsync` — per-distance status after manual entry; now derives groups from the already-loaded `raceCheckpoints` (removed a redundant DB query); the in-memory `coveredCheckpointIds.Add(recordedCheckpoint)` still satisfies its own distance group.
  4. `ResultsService.CalculateResultsAsync` — per-distance finisher check (both occurrences) + finish time from a split at ANY checkpoint at the finish-gate distance (earliest `SplitTimeMs`; handles nullable `SplitTimes.CheckpointId`).
- **Verify:** `dotnet build` per site ✅ ×4 · full solution ✅ · assigner tests ✅ 19/19 · traced the 21.1km two-mandatory-device case through all four sites (sibling-only detection → Finished with time+rank; dual detection → one rank row).
- **⚠️ Env note:** .NET 8 runtime is no longer installed on this machine (only 10.0.8) — `dotnet test` needs `$env:DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD='LatestMajor'` to run the net8.0 test project. Consider retargeting tests to net10.0 or installing the .NET 8 runtime.
- **✅ DNS start-gate also fixed (user-approved follow-up):** the DNS check in `CalculateRaceResultsAsync` now loads start readings from ALL checkpoint IDs at the start distance (`startGateCheckpointIds`) instead of the single `startCheckpoint.Id` — a participant read only by a sibling/child device at the start line now counts as "started" (DNF, not DNS). The DNS gate exists only in this site (ResultsService paths classify Finished/DNF only). Build ✅ · 19/19 tests ✅.
- **Prod verification (after deploy):** reprocess RaceId 47 (7th GGHM 21KM), then
  `SELECT Status, COUNT(*) FROM Results r JOIN Participants p ON r.ParticipantId=p.Id WHERE p.RaceId=47 AND r.IsActive=1 AND r.IsDeleted=0 GROUP BY Status;`
  Expected ≈ 142 Finished / 25 DNF / 51 DNS (Excel baseline).

### 2026-06-12 — BUG-27 Phase A (gun clamp on net-time start baseline) — Sonnet EXECUTE

- **Confirmed issue (prod, 7th GGHM RaceId 47):** Bibs 2242/2127 crossed the Start mat ~2m22s BEFORE the gun (`Race.StartTime`). The `EarlyStartCutOff` window (default 10 min, `RFIDImportService.cs:4061`) admits those pre-gun reads, but nothing clamped the baseline → `NetTime = finish − startMat` came out LARGER than `GunTime = finish − gun` → impossible Chip 1:40:45 > Gun 1:38:23.
- **Fix (1 site, `RFIDImportService.DeduplicateAndNormalizeAsync`, ~line 2062):** when building `participantStartTimes`, clamp the net baseline up to the gun: `clampedStart = (raceStartTime.HasValue && raceStartTime > startMat) ? gun : startMat`. Guarded on `raceStartTime.HasValue`. Logs each clamp. For normal (post-gun) starters `Max(startMat, gun) = startMat` → no change. This makes every non-start checkpoint's `NetTime = finishChip − gun = GunTime` for early starters → fixes 2242/2127.
- **Selection direction unchanged (already correct):** start=LAST / finish=FIRST / intermediate=FIRST were already implemented at `2080-2088` (start identified by min `DistanceFromStart`). Not touched.
- **⚠️ Item-2 verification — FINDING (NOT clean, pre-existing, NOT fixed this pass):** the start-checkpoint's OWN row sets `netTime = gunTime` (`2151-2156`) using the RAW `gunTime = startMat − gun`, which is **negative for early starters** — it does NOT consume the clamped baseline. So the start ROW stores negative Net/Gun for 2242/2127. This is pre-existing (was negative before) and does NOT affect the headline finish-time bug (the start row isn't a `finishReading`, so it skips the `negativeGunTimes` Fail-gate at `2446`; its split is already skipped by the `splitTimeMs < 0` guard at `4605`). Logical-correct value would be `0` (clamp start-row net to `max(0, startMat − clampedBaseline)`). **Left for user decision / fold into BUG-25.**
- **Decision (C) — single-mat (startCheckpointId == finishCheckpointId):** code-level — occurs only when a race has ONE checkpoint (or all checkpoints at the same `DistanceFromStart`), since start = min-distance Id and finish = max-distance Id. In that case the single group hits `isStartCheckpoint == true` → picks **LAST** → a single-mat finish would wrongly take the last crossing instead of FIRST. **Could not query prod DB from this sandbox** — user to run the SQL below to confirm whether any real race hits it. Documented only, not fixed (out of Phase A scope).
  ```sql
  -- Races whose only distinct checkpoint distance is one value → start Id == finish Id (single logical mat)
  SELECT c.RaceId, COUNT(DISTINCT c.Id) AS CheckpointCount,
         COUNT(DISTINCT c.DistanceFromStart) AS DistinctDistances
  FROM Checkpoints c
  WHERE c.IsActive = 1 AND c.IsDeleted = 0
  GROUP BY c.RaceId
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.DistanceFromStart) = 1;
  ```
- **Build:** `Runnatics.Services` ✅ 0 errors (14 pre-existing warnings). **Tests:** assigner ✅ 19/19 (`DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor` for net8.0).
- **➡️ BUG-25 ordering:** BUG-25 (start-row split = 00:00:00) MUST build on this clamped baseline — clamp first (done), then BUG-25. BUG-25 can also resolve the item-2 start-row negative-net finding (set start net/split to 0).
- **Prod verify (after deploy):** reprocess RaceId 47, then confirm 2242/2127 have `NetTime ≤ GunTime` (Chip ≤ Gun) on `Results`.

### 2026-06-13 — BUG-24 (public grouped leaderboard not honouring Leaderboard Settings) — Opus EXECUTE (backend half)

- **Root cause (NOT settings resolution — that was correct):** `PublicResultsService.GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync` resolved settings via the right hierarchy (race row where `OverrideSettings==true`, else event row `RaceId==null`, else defaults — same chain as `GetEffectivePublicLeaderboardSettingsAsync`), but **mis-applied** them. A single `rankOnNet = SortByOverallChipTime` drove BOTH Overall and Category sort → Category ignored `SortByCategory*`; `NumberOfResultsToShowOverall` was never read (Overall used pageSize paging); `ShowOverallResults`/`ShowCategoryResults` were never read and the DTO didn't carry them.
- **Settings storage:** one `LeaderboardSettings` table; event row = `RaceId NULL`, race row = `RaceId set` + `OverrideSettings` bool. Columns: `Show{Overall,Category}Results`, `SortBy{Overall,Category}{Chip,Gun}Time`, `NumberOfResultsToShow{Overall,Category}`, `OverrideSettings`.
- **Fixes (backend, approved scope):**
  1. **Independent sort:** `overallRankOnNet` (←`SortByOverallChipTime ?? true`) drives Overall sort + podium + top-level `RankBy`; `categoryRankOnNet` (←`SortByCategoryChipTime ?? true`) drives category `OrderBy` + per-category `RankBy` label.
  2. **Independent counts:** `categoryTopN` from `NumberOfResultsToShowCategory` (keeps historical default 3 when unset, non-showAll); new `overallTopN` from `NumberOfResultsToShowOverall` caps `OverallResults` (paging disabled when capped); no cap when `showAll`.
  3. **Show toggles:** new `ShowOverall`/`ShowCategory` bools on `PublicGroupedLeaderboardDto`; when OFF the section's list is built empty so the public page hides it.
  4. **Per-section labels:** new `OverallRankBy`/`CategoryRankBy` (additive). Both use the **no-space `"ChipTime"`/`"GunTime"`** format — the form the FE already string-matches on top-level `RankBy` (per BUG-08 review; the spaced `"Chip time"` on `PublicCategoryGroupDto.RankBy` is never consumed and was left as-is).
- **Files modified:** `PublicResultsService.cs` (`GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync` only), `Public/PublicGroupedLeaderboardDto.cs` (4 additive fields).
- **Out of scope (frontend):** the flat `/results` page (`GetPublicEventResultsAsync`) already returns `LeaderboardSettings` to the FE correctly and applies nothing itself — if that page misbehaves it's a UI fix (`C:\Projects\Runnatics.UI`, not in this workspace).
- **✅ UI half DONE (2026-06-13, repo `C:\Projects\Runnatics.UI\Runnatics.Ui`):** consumes the new fields.
  - `src/api/publicApi.ts` — added `overallRankBy?`, `categoryRankBy?`, `showOverall?`, `showCategory?` to `GroupedLeaderboardResponse` (all optional → old responses behave as before).
  - `EventResultsPage.tsx` (real Overall table + Age Category) — split `isGunTime` into `isGunTimeOverall` (←`overallRankBy ?? rankBy`) and `isGunTimeCategory` (←`categoryRankBy ?? rankBy`); Overall podium/table use the overall flag, Age Category uses the category flag; Overall section + its Pagination gated on `showOverall`, Age Category on `showCategory` (default true via `!== false`).
  - `LeaderboardPage.tsx` & `GlobalResultsPage.tsx` (podium + male/female category columns) — category columns use `categoryRankBy`; podium gated on `showOverall`; category grid gated on `showCategory`.
  - **Build:** `npm run build` (Vite) ✅ built in ~13s, all bundles emitted. (Raw `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json` floods pre-existing project-wide `@/`-alias + verbatimModuleSyntax errors unrelated to this change — Vite is the source of truth, per prior rounds.)
  - **Not committed yet** — awaiting user go-ahead to push the UI repo.
- **Build:** `Runnatics.Services` ✅ 0 errors (14 pre-existing warnings). **Trace (event SRWYS41SkT, event-level row, override OFF):** Overall→Chip/cap5/shown, Category→**Gun**/cap5/shown, sorts diverge. ✓
- **No SQL** (all columns already exist).

### 2026-06-13 — SplitTimes/ReadNormalized stale-row fix (Clear gate completion) — Opus EXECUTE

- **Unifying root cause (user-confirmed via prod RaceId 47):** the ENTIRE RFID pipeline is insert-only / skip-if-exists, so no shipped fix (BUG-04 SegmentTime, BUG-27 gun clamp) ever reaches data that was already processed:
  - `DeduplicateAndNormalizeAsync` filters out raw reads that already have a `ReadNormalized` (`~1855-1864`) → BUG-27 clamp never re-fired on Bibs 2242/2127.
  - `CreateSplitTimesFromNormalizedReadingsAsync` skips any `(ParticipantId, CheckpointId)` that already has a SplitTime (`~4578-4588`) → Bib 2262's May 5.25/15.75 km rows (old code, `SegmentTime == SplitTimeMs`) survived while the other 7 checkpoints got correct rebuilt rows.
  - The intended escape hatch (`ClearProcessedDataAsync`, and per-participant `ReprocessParticipantsAsync`) deleted Results + ReadNormalized + assignments but **NOT SplitTimes** → even a `forceReprocess=true` rebuild left the stale splits, and the splits skip-guard then skipped them.
- **🏛️ ARCHITECTURAL DECISION (user-approved):** the skip-guards are the **live-ingest concurrency-safety mechanism** — `LiveReadingService:155` (Raspberry Pi) and other incremental paths call `ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync` WITHOUT a Clear; insert-only/skip-existing keeps each live append cheap and idempotent (concurrent appends are safe). **A full rebuild is correctly gated by `forceReprocess=true` → `ClearProcessedDataAsync`, NOT by removing the skip-guards.** Removing the guards (the originally-proposed Fix 1/Fix 3) would make every Pi batch delete-and-rebuild the whole race's normalized data mid-event — the corruption risk we explicitly avoided. **So the fix completes the Clear gate; it does NOT touch the guards.**
- **Fixes (2 sites in `RFIDImportService`, both hard-delete to match the existing sibling `BulkDeleteAsync`/`DeleteRangeAsync` — these are explicit destructive resets, decision (A)):**
  1. **FIX A — `ClearProcessedDataAsync`** (new step "2b"): hard-delete all SplitTimes for the race (scoped `st.EventId == … && st.Participant.RaceId == …`, unfiltered on IsActive/IsDeleted so soft-deleted orphans are cleaned too), mirroring the ReadNormalized step. Added `SplitTimesCleared` to `ClearDataResponse` (+ Summary line).
  2. **FIX B — `ReprocessParticipantsAsync`** (new step "2b"): hard-delete the targeted participants' SplitTimes (`validParticipantIds.Contains(st.ParticipantId)`), mirroring their ReadNormalized `DeleteRangeAsync`, so the per-participant "Process Result" button also yields clean splits. Added `SplitTimesCleared` to `ReprocessParticipantsResponse`.
- **NOT changed (deliberately):** dedup skip-guard (`~1855`), splits skip-guard (`~4578`), and the existing ReadNormalized/Results delete semantics. Soft-delete remains correct only for the BUG-06 race-move rebuild (not a destructive reset).
- **Build:** `Runnatics.Services` ✅ 0 errors. **Tests:** assigner ✅ 19/19 (`DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor`).
- **▶️ RUNBOOK — repair prod RaceId 47 (and any race with stale timing data) AFTER deploy:**
  1. **Deploy** this build.
  2. **Full reprocess:** `POST /api/rfid/{eventId}/{raceId}/process-all?forceReprocess=true` — Clear now wipes Results + ReadNormalized + **SplitTimes** + assignments → `ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync` rebuilds everything from raw reads (empty tables → nothing to skip → BUG-27 clamp fires on every ReadNormalized, SegmentTime rebuilt on every SplitTime). (Manual equivalent: `DELETE …/clear-processed-data?keepUploads=true` then `POST …/process-all`.)
  3. **Verify:** (a) Bibs 2242/2127 `NetTime ≤ GunTime` (Chip ≤ Gun — clamp fired on rebuilt ReadNormalized); (b) Bib 2262 5.25/15.75 km `SegmentTime ≠ SplitTimeMs` (splits rebuilt with BUG-04 distance-chaining). Start-row split `= 0` is **BUG-25, separate** (still pending; must build on the BUG-27 clamped baseline).
  - ⚠️ Do NOT use a plain (non-force) reprocess to repair stale data — by design it preserves already-processed rows (live-ingest semantics). Repair REQUIRES the Clear gate.

### ▶️ NEXT — BUG-25 remaining surfaces (page-scoped public split details DONE 2026-06-13, `f5f148b`)

- **BUG-25 (GLOBAL split/race-time rules — not race-specific).** Rules confirmed by user:
  - **Start checkpoint (`DistanceFromStart = 0`):** Split Time = `00:00:00` (baseline, no prior checkpoint); Race Time = `00:00:00` (net-from-start-line is zero by definition).
  - **Every subsequent checkpoint:** Split Time = this checkpoint time − previous checkpoint time; Race Time = this checkpoint time − start-line crossing time.
  - Applies to EVERY place splits are calculated or displayed.
- **DONE:** ✅ **public participant split details page** — `PublicResultsService.GetPublicParticipantDetailAsync` now zeroes the start row (Split=Race=`00:00:00`, speed `—`) and computes segment-based speed (`f5f148b`, 2026-06-13).
- **✅ PROD VERIFIED (2026-06-13):** Multiple participants confirmed — Start row `00:00:00`/`00:00:00`/`—`; all segment speeds in realistic running range (10–15 km/h); Race Time increases consistently row to row; Split Times sensible per segment. Public-facing results correct and ready for Punit/Deepender to test the full flow.
- **➡️ REMAINING SURFACES (lower priority — internal/admin only):**
  1. **admin participant detail / BIB drill-down** — start row = `00:00:00`/`00:00:00`; segment split times.
  2. **leaderboard split view**.
  3. **results export (Excel)** (`ResultsExportService`).
  4. **public grouped leaderboard per-participant drill-down**.
  - Pattern to reuse: distance-keyed start-row detection (`DistanceFromStart == 0`), Split=`SegmentTime` (start→0), Race=`SplitTimeMs` (start→0); see `f5f148b` for the reference implementation.
  - ⚠️ Also fold in the latent **pace-semantics inconsistency** flagged 2026-06-13: `ResultsService.CalculateResultsAsync:167` writes `SplitTimes.Pace` as a *cumulative* avg pace while `RecordManualTimeAsync` writes a *segment* pace — decide one definition and apply consistently while touching these surfaces.

- **BUG-24 — FULLY DONE** (backend `9b9f510`/`80ee3e9`; UI `3860638`, both merged to master 2026-06-13).
  - **UI changes (GlobalResultsPage.tsx only, commit `3860638`):**
    1. **Category cap:** dropped `showAll: true` from `getGroupedLeaderboard` call → backend now applies `NumberOfResultsToShowCategory` per age-bracket.
    2. **Finisher header removed:** deleted the `{data?.totalFinishers} finishers` block from the Leaderboard header. Participant-stats "of N" on `ParticipantDetailPage` is a different endpoint — left untouched.
    3. **Gender filter:** replaced `getResultBrackets` cascade (age-category dropdown) with a hardcoded Male/Female dropdown; renamed `bracket`→`gender` state; passes `gender:` to API (not `category:`). Selecting Male/Female filters the backend's `genderCategories` → grid shows only that gender's age-bracket columns; both genders shown by default.
    4. **Dual podium:** replaced `derivePodium` (single mixed-gender pool) with `derivePodiumForGender(genderCategories, targetGender, overallRankBy)`; derive `malePodium` + `femalePodium` separately; render both side-by-side in a grid (Male label | Female label); only show the matching gender's podium when filter is active. Now reads `overallRankBy ?? rankBy` (was missing — `overallRankBy` was never consumed) → podium sort honours Overall sort setting independently of Category sort.

### 2026-05-29 — backend-agent — Live Timing Ingest (Raspberry Pi → API)

- **Branch**: `master`
- **What was built**: `POST /api/rfid/{eventId}/{raceId}/live-readings` — receives flat RFID readings from a Raspberry Pi timing mat, saves to DB, pushes SignalR crossing events, then triggers the full RFID processing pipeline asynchronously to produce live rankings.
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/RFID/LiveReadingDto.cs` — single reading: `Epc, Time (Unix ms), Antenna, Rssi, Channel`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/RFID/LiveReadingsRequest.cs` — batch body: `DeviceId (MAC) + List<LiveReadingDto>`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/RFID/LiveReadingResponse.cs` — response: `Accepted, Skipped, BatchId (encrypted)`
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/ILiveReadingService.cs` — interface with `IngestAsync(eventId, raceId, request, ct)`
  - `Runnatics.Services/LiveReadingService.cs` — full implementation
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/RFIDController.cs` — added `IngestLiveReadings` action, injected `ILiveReadingService`
  - `Runnatics.Api/Program.cs` — registered `ILiveReadingService`; added `X-Device-Key` middleware (placed before the existing `X-Public-Key` guard)
  - `Runnatics.Api/appsettings.json` — added `DeviceApi:Key = "SET_IN_AZURE_ENV_VARS"`
- **Authentication**: `X-Device-Key` header validated in inline middleware (same pattern as `X-Public-Key`). Azure env var: `DeviceApi__Key`. Dynamic IP → API key is the sole auth mechanism (no Azure IP allowlist).
- **Processing flow**:
  1. Decrypt eventId + raceId → load Event (TenantId, timezone) → resolve Device by MAC
  2. Get/create today's `UploadBatch` (SourceType = `"online_webhook"`, IsLiveSync = true, FileFormat = `"LIVE"`)
  3. Map `LiveReadingDto` → `RawRFIDReading` (ProcessResult = `"Pending"`, same schema as offline pipeline)
  4. Save to DB, update batch stats
  5. Push immediate SignalR `CheckpointCrossings` events (EPC → Participant lookup)
  6. Fire-and-forget: new DI scope → `IRFIDImportService.ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync(eventId, raceId)` → dedup → normalize → split times → per-participant rankings → SignalR push
- **Key decisions**:
  - Reuses existing `UploadBatch` + `RawRFIDReading` tables — no schema changes needed
  - One batch per device per race per day (keyed: `DeviceId + EventId + RaceId + Date`)
  - `AuditProperties.CreatedBy = 0` (system) since request is device-authenticated, not user-authenticated
  - Fire-and-forget uses `IServiceScopeFactory` to create a fresh scope so scoped services are not disposed
  - `ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync` is idempotent (dedup handles re-runs); concurrent runs are safe
  - `deviceId` in request body is the Pi's MAC address — must match a registered `Device.DeviceMacAddress` (normalized: lowercase, no colons)
- **Pi request format**:
  ```
  POST /api/rfid/{encryptedEventId}/{encryptedRaceId}/live-readings
  X-Device-Key: <secret>
  { "deviceId": "00162512dbb0", "readings": [{ "epc": "...", "time": 1777163620641, "antenna": 2, "rssi": -74.0, "channel": 2 }] }
  ```

### 2026-05-15 — backend-agent — Testing Feedback Round 1 (BUG API-1 through API-13)

- **Branch**: `bugfix/testing-round-1`
- **What was built**: 11 bugs fixed across RFID processing, manual timing, public leaderboard, and dashboard.
- **Schema changes** (`db/scripts/TestingFeedback_Round1_SchemaChanges_20260515.sql`):
  - `Participants`: `ManualDistance DECIMAL(8,3)`, gender normalization (M/F)
  - `Checkpoints`: `IsMandatory BIT DEFAULT 1`
  - `Races`: `IsTimed BIT DEFAULT 1`
  - `RawRFIDReadings`: `IsMultipleEpc BIT DEFAULT 0`
  - `UploadBatches`: removed unique index on FileHash, added `TotalTagsInFile INT`, `TagsProcessed INT`
  - Performance indexes on Participants and RawRFIDReadings
- **BUG API-1**: `GET /api/participants/{eventId}/{raceId}/{participantId}/detections` — participant RFID detections grouped by checkpoint (`ParticipantDetectionsResponse`, `GetDetectionsAsync` in `ParticipantImportService`)
- **BUG API-2 + API-11**: MultipleEPC detection (comma/pipe in EPC string → `IsMultipleEpc=true`, `ProcessResult="MultipleEPC"`); skip EPC→participant mapping for multi-EPC rows; removed duplicate FileHash checks from both upload methods; `TotalTagsInFile`/`TagsProcessed` tracking; `IsMultipleEpc` added to `RfidRawReadingDto`
- **BUG API-3**: `RecordManualTimeAsync` now UPSERTS SplitTimes (creates row if missing, updates otherwise); accepts elapsed ms or IST-from-midnight (auto-detects); no longer errors for first-time manual entry
- **BUG API-6**: `PUT /api/participants/{eventId}/{raceId}/{participantId}/race-category` — changes AgeCategory and recalculates rankings; `ChangeParticipantCategoryAsync` in `ResultsService`
- **BUG API-7**: `POST /api/participants/{eventId}/{raceId}/{participantId}/process-result` — re-triggers ranking calc for one participant; `ProcessParticipantResultAsync` + shared `ReprocessParticipantInternalAsync` in `ResultsService`
- **BUG API-8 + API-10**: Fixed gender filter ("M"/"F" normalized to "Male"/"Female" for comparison and display); fixed race filter from `Contains` to exact `==` (prevents cross-race contamination); gender grouping in leaderboard also normalized
- **BUG API-9**: RFID `ProcessRFIDImportAsync` now checks `Race.IsTimed`; if `false` returns `Status=Skipped` without EPC→participant mapping
- **BUG API-12**: SupportQuery — all 7 endpoints confirmed fully functional; bug is UI-side (no backend change)
- **BUG API-13**: Added `GET /api/dashboard/event/{eventId}/stats` and `GET /api/dashboard/race/{eventId}/{raceId}/stats` returning `EventDashboardStatsDto` / `RaceDashboardStatsDto` with registrations, finishers, DNF/DNS, gender/category breakdowns
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Participant/ChangeRaceCategoryRequest.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Participants/ParticipantDetectionsResponse.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/RFID/ReaderFileUploadResponse.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Dashboard/EventDashboardStatsDto.cs`
  - `db/scripts/TestingFeedback_Round1_SchemaChanges_20260515.sql`
- **Key decisions**:
  - `IdEncryptor` AutoMapper converter only handles `int`; for `long` RawRFIDReading IDs use `_encryptionService.Encrypt(id.ToString())` directly
  - BUG API-4 is covered by API-1 shape (no DISTINCT/GroupBy — all detections shown)
  - BUG API-5 (split time segment calculation fix) and BUG API-14 (performance hardening) are not yet implemented
- **Pending**:
  - BUG API-5: Split time correctness (segment = current − previous chip time; IsMandatory-based Finished/DNF status)
  - BUG API-14: Performance hardening (Brotli/Gzip compression, output cache on public endpoints, WAF note in DEPLOYMENT.md)
  - Run `db/scripts/TestingFeedback_Round1_SchemaChanges_20260515.sql` against Azure SQL before deploying

### 2026-06-09 — Bug Fix Round 2 (BUG-01, BUG-02, BUG-03)

- **BUG-01: Multiple Tags Auto-Map**
  - **API fix** (`RfidReaderService.cs`): When debounce batch fires with `Count > 1`, now sends single `MultipleEpcDetected(string[] epcs)` SignalR event instead of N individual `EpcDetected` events.
  - **UI fixes**:
    - `useBibMappingHub.ts`: Added `multipleEpcEpcs: string[] | null` state + `MultipleEpcDetected` handler.
    - `useBibMappingRows.ts`: Added `setMultipleEpcError(participantId)` function — sets `status: 'error', isMultipleEpc: true` on a row. Added `override.isMultipleEpc` to rows memo so override takes precedence over server value.
    - `BibMapping.tsx`: Wired up `useBibMappingHub`, watches `multipleEpcEpcs` → calls `setMultipleEpcError(focusedRowId)`. Added 500ms lockout on `handleSubmit` — if a second submission arrives within 500ms of the last successful map, it's rejected as multiple EPC (guards against USB keyboard reader rapid EPC1+Enter → EPC2+Enter pattern).

- **BUG-02: BIB Numbers Not Sequential**
  - Root cause: `OrderBy(p => p.BibNumber)` on string column → lexicographic sort ("1","10","11","2").
  - Fixed ALL four sort locations with length-first approach: `.OrderBy(p => p.BibNumber == null ? 0 : p.BibNumber.Length).ThenBy(p => p.BibNumber)` (EF Core translates this to `ORDER BY CASE WHEN ... THEN 0 ELSE LEN(BibNumber) END, BibNumber`).
  - Files modified: `BibMappingService.cs` (line 568), `ParticipantImportService.cs` (lines 1799, 475, 1987).

- **BUG-03: Checkpoint Creation Generic Error**
  - **Root cause #1**: Duplicate `CreateMap<CheckpointRequest, Checkpoint>()` in `AutoMapperMappingProfile.cs` — second registration (lines 421-427) overwrote the complete first one (363-374). Second was missing `AuditProperties`, `Device`, `ParentDevice` ignore rules. **Fix**: Removed the duplicate registration.
  - **Root cause #2**: `CheckpointsService.Create` catch block set `ErrorMessage = "Error creating checkpoint."` with no details. **Fix**: Now sets `ErrorMessage = $"Error creating checkpoint: {ex.Message}"`.
  - **⚠️ BLOCKING**: The most likely actual runtime failure is still `SqlException: Invalid column name 'IsMandatory'` because `db/scripts/TestingFeedback_Round1_SchemaChanges_20260515.sql` has NOT been run against Azure SQL. Run this script manually before testing checkpoint creation.

- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Services/RfidReaderService.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Services/CheckpointsService.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Services/Mappings/AutoMapperMappingProfile.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Services/BibMappingService.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Services/ParticipantImportService.cs`
  - `src/main/src/hooks/useBibMappingHub.ts`
  - `src/main/src/pages/admin/bibMapping/useBibMappingRows.ts`
  - `src/main/src/pages/admin/bibMapping/BibMapping.tsx`

### 2026-06-09 — REVIEW + VERIFY findings (Bug Fix Round 2)

- **Result: FAIL.** Both `dotnet build` and `npm run build` pass (0 errors) but the build does NOT catch the headline defect.
- **🔴 BLOCKER 1 (BUG-01, `BibMapping.tsx`)**: `useEffect` at lines 162-166 references `focusedRowId` in its dependency array, but `focusedRowId` (useState) is declared later at line 172. The deps array is evaluated during render → Temporal Dead Zone → `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'focusedRowId' before initialization`. **The BIB Mapping page crashes/white-screens on every mount.** Fix: move `useBibMappingHub()` + the effect below the `focusedRowId` declaration.
- **🔴 BLOCKER 2 (BUG-01, `useBibMappingHub.ts` + `BibMapping.tsx`)**: `multipleEpcEpcs` is set on `MultipleEpcDetected` but never reset. Effect depends on `[multipleEpcEpcs, focusedRowId]`, so after one real multi-EPC event, every later focus change re-fires the effect and falsely flags the newly focused row as Multiple-EPC. Also does NOT reset on SignalR reconnect. Fix: expose `clearMultipleEpc()` from the hub and call it after consuming the event.
- **🟡 RISK 3 (BUG-01)**: The 500ms lockout calls `setMultipleEpcError`, which sets `isMultipleEpc: true`. That row then renders a static badge with disabled input/skip and the override survives refetch (prune keeps `status:'error'`). A legitimate fast scan (~2/sec) permanently bricks the BIB with no UI recovery. Recommend transient `flashError` instead, or add a clear/retry affordance.
- **🟡 RISK 4 (BUG-03, security)**: `CheckpointsController` returns `ErrorMessage` (now containing `ex.Message`) in the 500 body. SQL exceptions can leak table/column or server/instance names. Approved as-is, but consider gating raw `ex.Message` to non-prod.
- **✅ BUG-01 server side correct** (`RfidReaderService.cs`): `batch.Count > 1` → single `MultipleEpcDetected`; SignalR typing matches client.
- **✅ BUG-02 FIXED**: All 4 sort sites identical (`BibMappingService.cs:568`, `ParticipantImportService.cs:475/1800/1989`); verified `1,2,9,10,11,20,100` orders correctly. Minor: alphanumeric BIBs (`A1/A10/B2`) order by length-then-lexical (acceptable).
- **✅ BUG-03 code FIXED** (duplicate AutoMapper map removed; error surfaced) but **still BLOCKED on running `TestingFeedback_Round1_SchemaChanges_20260515.sql`** (adds `IsMandatory`).
- **No files were modified during this review phase** (CLAUDE.md Rule 4). Blockers 1+2 and Risk 3 are pending a follow-up EXECUTE pass.

### 2026-06-09 — EXECUTE pass 2 — BUG-01 review fixes (Blockers 1+2, Risk 3)

- **FIX 1 (Blocker 1 — TDZ crash)**: Moved `useBibMappingHub()` + its `useEffect` in `BibMapping.tsx` to BELOW the `focusedRowId` useState declaration (now at lines 163/168-178). The deps array no longer reads `focusedRowId` before initialization → no more render crash.
- **FIX 2 (Blocker 2 — stale multipleEpcEpcs)**: Added `clearMultipleEpc()` to `useBibMappingHub` (sets `multipleEpcEpcs` back to null). The `BibMapping.tsx` effect now calls `clearMultipleEpc()` immediately after consuming the event, so a later focus change can't re-fire it. Also reset `multipleEpcEpcs` to null in the hub's `onreconnected` handler.
- **FIX 3 (Risk 3 — sticky lockout)**: The 500ms USB lockout in `handleSubmit` now silently `return`s instead of calling `setMultipleEpcError`. It's a debounce gate, not an error state — the row stays mappable once the window expires. Removed the now-unused `setMultipleEpcError` from `handleSubmit`'s dep array (still used by the multi-EPC effect).
- **Files modified**: `src/main/src/hooks/useBibMappingHub.ts`, `src/main/src/pages/admin/bibMapping/BibMapping.tsx` (BUG-01 scope only — BUG-02/03 files untouched).
- **Builds**: `npm run build` ✅ 0 errors · `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors.
- **Re-trace**: TCP multi-tag → one row flagged then state cleared (no poisoning of later rows). USB rapid-scan → 2nd scan silently gated, row stays mappable; deliberate re-scan after window maps normally; first scan of session passes (ref starts at 0). **BUG-01 now FIXED.**

### 2026-06-09 — Bug Fix Round 2 / Round 2 (BUG-04, BUG-05, BUG-07)

- **Key finding**: the bulk pipeline (`RFIDImportService`) and `ResultsService` have TWO divergent implementations of split-time and result calculation. The pipeline (runs after every upload) used the wrong logic; the correct logic already existed in `ResultsService`. Fixes align the pipeline with the correct logic.

- **BUG-04 (split/cumulative)** — `RFIDImportService.CreateSplitTimesFromNormalizedReadingsAsync`:
  - Root cause: split creation ordered each participant's readings by `ChipTime`, so stored `SegmentTime` chained in clock order, while every display path orders by `Checkpoint.DistanceFromStart` and prefers the stored `SegmentTime` → segments didn't sum to the displayed cumulative when chip-time order ≠ distance order (missed checkpoints, loops, clock skew).
  - Fix: order readings by `Checkpoint.DistanceFromStart` then `ChipTime` (both the main query and the per-participant re-sort). `SplitTimeMs` (cumulative) stays `ChipTime − raceStart`. Display unchanged.
  - Decision (user): Cumulative = net-from-start-line (chip time); start row ~0. Display already does this — no display change needed.

- **BUG-05 (DNF/Finished)** — `RFIDImportService.CalculateRaceResultsAsync`:
  - Root cause: status keyed only on presence at the single max-distance finish checkpoint; `IsMandatory` ignored. (Correct rule already in `ResultsService.ComputeParticipantStatusAsync`.)
  - Fix: load mandatory checkpoint ids (fallback = highest-distance checkpoint if none flagged); `Finished` = ReadNormalized covers ALL mandatory ids; `DNS` = no start reading; `DNF` = started but missing ≥1 mandatory. Finish time/ranking now from the highest mandatory checkpoint (`finishGateCheckpoint`), ranked by GunTime. Backward compatible when no mandatory flagged.

- **BUG-07 (wrong participant in wrong race)** — `PublicResultsService.GetPublicResultsAsync`:
  - Root cause: public Overall results filtered by `r.Race.Title` string (or not at all when no race selected) and sorted by per-race `OverallRank`, merging races so a 5KM Rank-1 leaked into the 10KM list. (Admin `GetLeaderboardAsync` and `GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync` are correctly RaceId-scoped — not the leak.)
  - Fix: changed signature to `int? raceId` and filter `r.RaceId == raceId.Value`; `GetPublicEventResultsAsync` passes the resolved `selectedRace?.Id`; bib-lookup keeps `raceId: null` (intentional cross-race bib search).
  - Decision (user): public Overall page should use per-race tabs (each scoped by RaceId), Male/Female split, Overall section before Age Category — primarily a FRONTEND change, still pending in the UI.

- **Stale-data audit (race move, `ParticipantImportService.UpdateParticipantExtendedAsync`)**: race reassignment correctly migrates Results/SplitTimes/ReadNormalized/ChipAssignment to the new participant, sets `Results.RaceId → target`, recalcs both races' ranks, soft-deletes the old participant. **No orphaned rows remain under the old RaceId** → not a BUG-07 cause.
  - ⚠️ **Flagged for BUG-06 (not fixed here)**: migrated `SplitTimes`/`ReadNormalized` keep their **source-race `CheckpointId`**, so after a move the timing data references the wrong race's checkpoints (orphaned) → moved participant shows missing splits / wrong status in the new race. Needs checkpoint remapping by distance — belongs to BUG-06 data-transfer scope.

- **Files modified**: `RFIDImportService.cs` (BUG-04 + BUG-05), `PublicResultsService.cs` (BUG-07).
- **Build**: `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors.
- **Pending**: BUG-07 frontend (race tabs / M-F split / section order); BUG-06 checkpoint-remap on race move.

### 2026-06-09 — REVIEW + VERIFY findings (BUG-04, BUG-05, BUG-07)

- **Result: PASS for all traced scenarios** (`dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors). Splits 0/5/10/21.1 chain correctly and sum to cumulative; missed-mandatory → DNF; missed non-mandatory → Finished; public 10 KM page shows only 10 KM. No DTO changes; per-participant reprocess + admin leaderboard unaffected (now consistent with the bulk pipeline).
- **🟠 FLAW I introduced (BUG-07 edge case), NOT yet fixed** — `PublicResultsService.GetPublicEventResultsAsync` (~line 86-92): when a race title is supplied but does NOT resolve to a published race, `selectedRace` is null → `selectedRace?.Id` null → `GetPublicResultsAsync` applies no race filter → returns ALL races merged (re-introducing the cross-race leak). Old `Race.Title == raceName` returned empty in that case. Recommended fix: when `race` is non-empty but `selectedRace == null`, short-circuit to empty published results. Happy path (valid title) is correct.
- **Edge cases verified safe**: `DistanceFromStart` is non-nullable `decimal` (no NULL ordering risk); `IsMandatory` non-nullable bool; zero-checkpoints guarded (Failed) before mandatory logic; `GetPublicResultByBibAsync` keeps `raceId: null` (intentional cross-race bib search).
- **Pre-existing risks (NOT introduced, flagging only)**: (1) if every checkpoint is a child (`ParentDeviceId` set), `parentCheckpoints.First()` in `CalculateRaceResultsAsync` throws; (2) within a single batch, two readings at the same checkpoint can create duplicate `SplitTimes` rows (dedup key only checks pre-existing DB rows).
- **✅ BUG-07 unresolved-race flaw FIXED**: `GetPublicEventResultsAsync` now short-circuits to an empty published result set when `race` is non-empty but `selectedRace == null` (race not found / unpublished), instead of falling through to an unfiltered all-races query. Happy path (valid title → filter by RaceId) and no-race-selected path (race empty → all races, backward compat) unchanged. `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors.

### 2026-06-09 — Bug Fix Round 2 / Round 3 (BUG-06, BUG-14)

- **BUG-06 (race-category change — data transfer + reprocess)** — `ParticipantImportService.UpdateParticipantExtendedAsync` race-move block:
  - Injected `IRFIDImportService` into `ParticipantImportService` (no circular dep — RFIDImportService doesn't reference it; both already registered in Program.cs 229/234).
  - Build a `sourceCheckpointId → targetCheckpointId` map by `DistanceFromStart` (Name tiebreak) before the move transaction.
  - Inside the transaction: **soft-delete** the migrated `SplitTimes` (rebuilt later); reassign `ReadNormalized` to the new participant AND **remap `CheckpointId`** to the target race's equivalent; readings with no target equivalent are **soft-deleted**. Kept old-race rank recalc; removed the redundant target-race rank recalc.
  - After the transaction commits (not nested): call `_rfidImportService.CreateSplitTimesFromNormalizedReadingsAsync` + `CalculateRaceResultsAsync` for the **target race** (encrypted `participant.EventId` + encrypted `targetRaceId`) → rebuilds splits against the target's gun start and recomputes mandatory-aware status/ranks. Reprocess failures are logged, not fatal (the move already committed).
  - Decisions (user): full reprocess via the pipeline; soft-delete orphaned readings; reprocess TARGET race only.
  - "Process Result" button already exists (UI + `ProcessParticipantResultAsync`) — no new endpoint.

- **BUG-14 (manual time edit)**:
  - **Backend guard** (`ResultsService.RecordManualTimeAsync`): if `race.IsTimed` and the participant has no active `ChipAssignment` (`UnassignedAt == null && IsActive && !IsDeleted`) → set `ErrorMessage` ("Map an EPC chip… before recording a manual time for a timed race.") and return null (no throw). Applies to ALL checkpoints.
  - **Controller** (`RFIDController.RecordManualTime`): added `ErrorMessage.Contains("EPC")` to the BadRequest branch so the guard returns 400 (not 500); the UI already surfaces `error.message` in the snackbar.
  - **DTO** (`CheckpointTimeInfo`): added encrypted `CheckpointId`, populated in `ResultsService.LoadCheckpointTimesAsync` (loops over every active race checkpoint) — gives the UI an addressable id for checkpoints with no split.
  - **UI** (`ParticipantDetail.tsx` + `CheckpointTime.ts` model): the splits/manual-time table now iterates the full `participant.checkpointTimes` list (merging the matching split by name) instead of `participant.splitTimes`. Every existing checkpoint — including missed ones and newly created ones — now renders an editable manual-time row keyed by the encrypted `checkpointId`. Satisfies "works for all checkpoints" + "auto-activates when a checkpoint is created". EPC-guard error shows via the existing snackbar.

- **Files modified**: `ParticipantImportService.cs`, `ResultsService.cs`, `RFIDController.cs`, `CheckpointTimeInfo.cs`, `ParticipantDetail.tsx`, `models/participants/CheckpointTime.ts`.
- **Builds**: `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors · `npm run build` ✅ 0 errors.
- **Pending (still open from earlier rounds)**: BUG-07 frontend (race tabs / M-F split / section order).

### 2026-06-09 — REVIEW + VERIFY findings (BUG-06, BUG-14)

- **Result: PASS.** `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors · `npm run build` ✅ 0 errors. No blocking flaws.
- **BUG-06 verified**: 21.1KM→10KM move soft-deletes 15/21.1km readings (no target equivalent), remaps 0/5/10km to new participant + new CheckpointId; exact-distance match only (different distances drop their readings, per approved design); DI of IRFIDImportService is acyclic; SplitTimes soft-delete uses correct audit pattern; ReadNormalized reassignment sets ParticipantId=newParticipant.Id AND remapped CheckpointId.
- **BUG-06 limitation (documented, acceptable)**: the post-commit reprocess (`CreateSplitTimes`/`CalculateRaceResults`) returns `Status="Failed"` rather than throwing, so a reprocess failure can't roll back the committed move — it leaves the moved participant with remapped readings but stale/empty splits+ranks, recoverable via the existing "Process Result" button (logged as warning).
- **BUG-14 verified**: Timed + no chip → 400 with the EPC message in the snackbar; Timed + chip → succeeds; Non-timed → guard skipped; zero checkpoints → empty table (no crash); encrypted CheckpointId decrypted in the service, encrypted in the service. Normal (no race-change) update path unaffected; `CheckpointTimeInfo`/`CheckpointTime` change is additive (only one constructor site).
- **BUG-14 limitation (pre-existing, not introduced)**: split↔checkpoint merge is by checkpoint NAME, so loop races with duplicate checkpoint names could mis-attach a split row. Same approach as the prior code.

### 2026-06-09 — Bug Fix Round 5 (P2 polish — BUG-09/11/12/15/16/17/18/19/20/21/22/23 + 2 TS errors)

- **Result: EXECUTE complete.** API `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors · UI `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅ 0 errors (both pre-existing TS errors fixed) · UI `npm run build` ✅. Decisions confirmed by user: BUG-11 show-all-rows; BUG-12 display/grouping-only (no import changes); BUG-16 column filter; BUG-09 keep race tabs.
- **Verify-only (no code), confirmed during research**: BUG-09 (race tabs already per-RaceId from Round 4), BUG-15 ("Detections by Checkpoint" table already shows every reading w/ reader name + timestamp), BUG-18 (backend already gates EPC on IsTimed — RFIDImportService:1036 skip, ResultsService:1419 manual-time chip guard; BibMapping never forces EPC), BUG-21 (public nav already uses `<a href>`/`<Link>`, no programmatic navigate in pages/public).

- **BUG-12 (no "Unknown" category)** — display/grouping layer only:
  - Backend: `PublicResultsService.cs:318` grouped leaderboard, `DashboardService.cs` event+race category breakdowns, `ResultsExportService.cs:219` Excel category sheet — all now `.Where(category not null/empty/"Unknown")` then group; uncategorized still appear in Overall.
  - `RFIDImportService.CalculateCategoryRankingsAsync` — only ranks finishers with a real category; explicitly nulls any stale `CategoryRank` on uncategorized finishers (so no misleading category rank shows).
  - UI defensive guard: `EventResultsPage`/`GlobalResultsPage`/`LeaderboardPage` filter out blank/"Unknown" category buckets before rendering.
  - Import write-defaults that store the literal "Unknown" were intentionally NOT touched (user decision — separate data-cleanup task).

- **BUG-17 (gender M/F)** — `PublicResultsService.MapToResultDto:1069` now emits raw "M"/"F" (was "Male"/"Female") → fixes the `/results` search list. `DashboardService` gender breakdown keys now raw "M"/"F". UI `ParticipantDetail.tsx` (3 sites: 872/1248/1354) show M/F; `ViewParticipants` grid Gender column gets a display-only `valueFormatter` (male→M, female→F, other→O; underlying value unchanged for filtering). Filter-dropdown OPTION labels left as "Male"/"Female" (selectors, not data display).

- **BUG-11 (remove "Show All Finishers")** — removed the button AND the 5-row cap in `EventResultsPage` `CategoryCard` and `GlobalResultsPage` `CategoryTable`; both now render all rows. `LeaderboardPage` already showed all.

- **BUG-16 (BIB drill-down columns)** — Gender column already existed. Added **Manual Distance** column (`agNumberColumnFilter`) to `ViewParticipants` AG-Grid + mapped `manualDistance` into rows. Backend: added `ManualDistance` (decimal?) to `ParticipantSearchReponse` — AutoMapper auto-maps it (search uses `_mapper.Map`, ParticipantImportService:499). No SQL (entity column already exists).

- **BUG-19 (reader re-upload + "X of Y tags")** — UI already supported re-upload + showed the snackbar, but it read `uploadedTags`/`totalTags` which the backend never returned (fell back to `totalReadings` → always "N of N"). Fix (backend): added `TotalTags` (=TotalTagsInFile) and `UploadedTags` (=valid distinct tags) to `RFIDImportResponse`, populated in both upload methods (`UploadRFIDFileAsync` + `UploadRFIDFileEventLevelAsync`). UI already consumes the camelCase fields → "X of Y" now accurate (X<Y when multi-EPC reads were skipped).

- **BUG-20 (support reply not working)** — diagnosed UI-side: the "Save Comment" form required a Ticket Status, but the status dropdown started empty → silent validation fail. (Backend auth is fine: the `sub ?? NameIdentifier` fallback mirrors the working `AuthenticationController`/`UserContextService`, email send is non-throwing.) Fix: `SupportQueryDetailPage` now defaults the comment status to the query's current status on load and keeps it selected after save.

- **BUG-23 (dashboard pie charts)** — Race-level chart existed but was fed the WRONG fields: backend returns `totalRegistered/totalFinishers/totalDnf/totalDns`, UI `DashboardStatsDto` reads `totalParticipants/totalStarted/totalFinished/totalDnfOrNotStarted` → existing race pie was rendering undefined. Fix: `DashboardService` now maps the raw backend shape (`totalStarted = registered − dns`, `totalDnfOrNotStarted = dnf + dns`) for BOTH event & race endpoints — repairs the race chart. Added new `EventStatsPanel.tsx` (cards Total/Started/Finished/DNF + progress pie Finished/Yet-to-Finish/DNF) mounted in `ViewEvent.tsx`. Note: backend has no first-class "Started"/in-progress field — values are derived from registered/finishers/dnf/dns.

- **TS errors fixed**: `ParticipantDetail.tsx:564` (used `checkpointName` in the success snackbar instead of leaving it unused); `RaceDashboard.tsx:218` (`(percent ?? 0)`).

- **Files modified — API**: `PublicResultsService.cs`, `DashboardService.cs`, `ResultsExportService.cs`, `RFIDImportService.cs`, `RFIDImportResponse.cs`, `ParticipantSearchReponse.cs`.
- **Files modified — UI**: public `EventResultsPage.tsx`/`GlobalResultsPage.tsx`/`LeaderboardPage.tsx`; admin `ParticipantDetail.tsx`/`ViewParticipants.tsx`/`SupportQueryDetailPage.tsx`/`races/RaceDashboard.tsx`/`events/ViewEvent.tsx`; `services/DashboardService.ts`; **new** `events/EventStatsPanel.tsx`.
- **No SQL scripts needed.** **Pending verify by user**: BUG-19 "X of Y" against a real multi-EPC file; BUG-23 event pie against an event with finishers; BUG-20 reply end-to-end.

### 2026-06-09 — FRONTEND REVIEW + VERIFY (Bug Fix Round 4 — UI repo @ C:\Projects\Runnatics.UI\Runnatics.Ui)

- **Result: PASS.** `npm run build` (vite) ✅ built in 12s. `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅ for all 4 reviewed files (2 pre-existing errors exist in UNRELATED files not touched this round: `ParticipantDetail.tsx:564` unused var, `RaceDashboard.tsx:218` possibly-undefined — flag to UI owner, not this round's scope).
- **✅ #4 rankBy mismatch is HANDLED — the backend "ChipTime"/"Chip time" inconsistency does NOT cause a silent failure.** All three pages read the **top-level** `data.rankBy` (the no-space `"ChipTime"`/`"GunTime"` form) and compare `rankBy === 'GunTime'`. The per-category spaced string (`"Chip time"`/`"Gun time"`) on `GroupedLeaderboardCategory.rankBy` is **never consumed** — each page derives its own label from the single top-level flag. Exact case match confirmed (BE emits `"GunTime"`, FE checks `'GunTime'`). All three default to `'ChipTime'` if absent. So the mismatch I flagged from the backend is inert here — but it stays a latent trap if anyone later wires a component to `category.rankBy`.
- **✅ #1 Race tabs**: `getGroupedLeaderboard(eventId, selectedRaceId, …)` is keyed by encrypted RaceId; refetch dep `[eventId, selectedRaceId, debouncedSearch]`. Defaults to first race via `useEffect([ev?.encryptedId]) → setSelectedRaceId(races[0]?.encryptedRaceId ?? '')`. Tab click resets page+search. `races` falls back from `ev.races` to `ev.categories`.
- **✅ #2 Overall section**: "Overall Result" (line 444) renders ABOVE "Age Category Result" (line 480). `OverallTable` shows a Gender column with `<GenderBadge>` (F/female→pink "F", else blue "M") — matches BE "M"/"F". `isGunTime` drives both the column header and the cell (`isGunTime ? p.gunTime : p.chipTime`).
- **✅ #3 Age Category**: both Male and Female columns are always rendered in the grid; an empty column shows `"No results."` (GenderColumn line 154-155) rather than being hidden.
- **✅ #5 Pagination**: client-side `PAGE_SIZE=50` over `tableRows`; `Pagination` hides when `totalPages<=1`; page resets on race/search change. Works.
- **🟠 EDGE-CASE BUG found (EventResultsPage Overall section, lines 310-314, 463-475)**: `podium = overallResults.slice(0,3)` and `tableRows = overallResults.slice(3)` — the table deliberately drops the top 3 (shown only on the podium). But `showPodium` requires `podium.length >= 3`. Consequences for small races:
  - **<3 finishers**: podium hidden (`length<3`) AND `tableRows` is empty → the Overall section renders **"No results available yet"** even though 1-2 finishers exist (they still appear in Age Category). Real, though only for tiny fields.
  - **exactly 3 finishers**: podium renders, but `pagedRows` is empty so a spurious **"No results available yet"** message also renders directly below the podium (cosmetic).
  - Fix suggestion: only carve the podium out of the table when `overallResults.length > 3` (e.g. `const usePodium = overallResults.length > 3; const tableRows = usePodium ? overallResults.slice(3) : overallResults;`), and gate the empty-state on `overallResults.length === 0`. Not a blocker for typical Racetik races.
- **GlobalResultsPage / LeaderboardPage**: identical, correct rankBy plumbing — `CategoryTable`/`CategorySection` take a `rankBy` prop from top-level `data.rankBy`, default `'ChipTime'`, label + time cell switch on `=== 'GunTime'`. No Overall-section podium logic there, so the edge-case bug above does not apply to them.
- **Note**: this review ran against the UI repo directly from the API session (file tools are path-agnostic) — no separate `claude` session was needed.

### 2026-06-09 — REVIEW + VERIFY findings (Bug Fix Round 4 — BUG-07 fe, BUG-08, BUG-10, BUG-13)

- **Result: backend PASS · frontend UNVERIFIABLE.** `dotnet build` ✅ 0 errors (13 pre-existing warnings). `npm run build` NOT RUN — the UI repo is not in this workspace (confirmed: no `src/main`, no `*.tsx`, no `publicApi.ts`; CONTEXT.md already notes "UI repo not present in this workspace"). The 4 frontend files in the review brief (`LeaderboardPage.tsx`, `GlobalResultsPage.tsx`, `EventResultsPage.tsx`, `publicApi.ts`) do not exist here, so BUG-07 race-tabs / Overall+M-F badges / Age-Category-below / female "No results", and the LeaderboardPage/GlobalResultsPage rankBy display fix CANNOT be reviewed from this repo.
- **Only 2 files actually changed this round** (`git status`): `PublicLeaderboardEntryDto.cs` (+`Gender`) and `PublicResultsService.cs` (showAll pageSize + Gender projection). Both changes are confined to `GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync`.
- **✅ Gender projection correct (concern #5)**: `OverallResults[].Gender = r.Participant.Gender` returns **"M"/"F"**, NOT "male"/"female". Confirmed via `ParticipantConfiguration.GenderNormalizer` — write-side normalizes M/MALE→"M", F/FEMALE→"F"; read-side is identity (`v => v`). Consistent with the existing in-memory `"M"=>"Male"` switch in the grouped view (which proves materialized value is "M"/"F", not "Male").
  - **🟡 Caveat (pre-existing data, not introduced)**: the read converter is identity, so any LEGACY row written before the normalizer existed could still hold "Male"/"Female" in the DB column and would project verbatim into `Gender` — a frontend M/F badge would then receive "Male". Grouped view tolerates this (switch `var g => g` passthrough); the flat OverallResults badge would not. Only a risk if un-normalized historical data exists.
- **🟠 FINDING — silent truncation >1000 finishers (concern #6)**: when `showAll=true`, `pageSize=1000` and `page=1` are FORCED. `OverallResults` does `.Skip(0).Take(1000)`, so a race with >1000 finishers silently drops entries 1001+ from the Overall section, and paging is disabled (page pinned to 1). `TotalOverall`/`TotalFinishers` still report the true count, so the UI shows "N finishers" but lists at most 1000. Only documented in a code comment ("up to 1000"); no API-level signal of truncation. **Age Category section is NOT affected** — `grouped` is built from the full `allFinishers` list, not the paginated slice. Acceptable for current event sizes but should be logged/flagged if events can exceed 1000.
- **✅ No regressions (concern #7)**: `Gender` DTO addition is purely additive (nullable, default null) — no existing consumer breaks; build confirms. Only `GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync` touched; `GetPublicResultsAsync`, `GetPublicResultByBibAsync`, podium build, and admin paths untouched. The removed top-of-method `page`/`pageSize` locals were relocated (not deleted) below the `topN` calc with identical clamping for the non-showAll path → behavior unchanged for regular browsing.
- **🟡 Minor (pre-existing) — RankBy string inconsistency**: top-level `RankBy` = `"ChipTime"`/`"GunTime"` (no space) while per-category `RankBy` = `"Chip time"`/`"Gun time"` (spaced, capitalized differently). If the frontend rankBy fix string-matches either, ensure it reads the right one. Not introduced this round.
- **Backend BUG-08/BUG-10/BUG-13**: no backend files for these in this round's diff — they are frontend-only (DTO additions aside). Cannot verify from this repo.
- **No files modified during review** (CLAUDE.md Rule 4).

### 2026-04-15 — backend-agent — Testing Feedback: Event/Participant/Race Fixes

- **What was built**: 5 feedback items addressed from testing
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Events/EventRequest.cs` — removed `TimeZone` and `Status` fields (set server-side)
  - `Runnatics.Services/EventsService.cs` — `CreateEventEntity` now sets `Status = Draft`, `TimeZone = "Asia/Kolkata"` server-side
  - `Runnatics.Services/Mappings/AutoMapperMappingProfile.cs` — ignore Status/TimeZone/MaxParticipants/RegistrationDeadline on EventRequest→Event; ignore TotalParticipants/EncodedEpcCount on Race→RaceResponse
  - `Runnatics.Models.Data/Entities/Participant.cs` — added `ManualDistance` (decimal?) and `LoopCount` (int?)
  - `Runnatics.Models.Data/Entities/Results.cs` — added `ManualFinishTimeMs` (long?) for admin-entered finish time
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Races/RaceResponse.cs` — added `TotalParticipants` and `EncodedEpcCount`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Participants/ParticipantSearchReponse.cs` — added `List<CheckpointTimeDto>? Checkpoints`
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IParticipantImportService.cs` — added `UpdateParticipantExtendedAsync` and `DeleteParticipantAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services/ParticipantImportService.cs` — implemented new methods; `PopulateCheckpointTimesAsync` now also builds `Checkpoints` list
  - `Runnatics.Services/RaceService.cs` — `LoadRaceResponsesAsync` now computes TotalParticipants and EncodedEpcCount via two GROUP BY queries
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/ParticipantsController.cs` — added `PUT ~/api/races/{raceId}/participants/{participantId}` and `DELETE ~/api/races/{raceId}/participants/{participantId}`
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Participants/CheckpointTimeDto.cs` — structured checkpoint time DTO
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Participant/UpdateParticipantRequest.cs` — extended update DTO with RunStatus/DisqualificationReason/ManualTime/ManualDistance/LoopCount/RaceId
  - `db/scripts/Participants_AddManualFields_20260415.sql` — ALTER TABLE scripts for new columns
- **Decisions made**:
  - Location fields (VenueName, City, Country) were already nullable/optional in EventRequest — no change needed
  - RunStatus "OK" maps to Participant.Status = "Registered" (or "Finished" in Results); other values pass through
  - Race reassignment in UpdateParticipantExtended soft-deletes the old record and creates a new one in the target race
  - Checkpoint times in participant search now return both `CheckpointTimes` (dictionary, backward-compat) and `Checkpoints` (ordered list)
  - EPC count uses ChipAssignment → Participant join since ChipAssignment has no direct RaceId
- **Pending**: Run `db/scripts/Participants_AddManualFields_20260415.sql` against Azure SQL to add the new columns

### 2026-04-08 — backend-agent — Generate & Download Participant Certificate

- **What was built**: `GET /api/certificates/participant/{participantId}/download` — generates a filled PNG certificate for a participant using SkiaSharp
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Services/Runnatics.Services.csproj` — added SkiaSharp 2.88.8 + SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux 2.88.8
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/ICertificatesService.cs` — added `GenerateParticipantCertificateAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services/CertificatesService.cs` — added IHttpClientFactory to constructor; new public method + 6 private helpers
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/CertificatesController.cs` — added `DownloadParticipantCertificate` action
- **Decisions made**:
  - Template selection: race-specific → IsDefault → event-wide (RaceId = null) — mirrors `GetTemplateByRaceAsync`
  - `Results.FinishTime` (ms) → ChipTime; `Results.GunTime` (ms) → GunTime; formatted as `HH:MM:SS` via TotalHours
  - `RaceCategory` = `Race.Title`; `Category` = `Participant.AgeCategory`
  - `Photo` field skipped — no photo property on `Participant`; `CustomText` renders `field.Content` verbatim
  - Background: base64 `BackgroundImageData` preferred over URL (fetched via IHttpClientFactory)
  - All IDs accept encrypted strings via existing `TryParseOrDecrypt`
- **Pending**: Photo field support requires adding a photo URL property to the Participant entity
### 2026-03-31 — backend-agent — SupportQuery / Contact Us Feature

- **Branch**: `feature/OnlineReadingsFlow` (existing branch)
- **What was built**: Full support query feature — public Contact Us submission, admin list/detail/update/comment/email/delete endpoints
- **Files created**:
  - `db/scripts/SupportQuery_CreateTables_20260331.sql` — 4 tables + status seed data
  - `Runnatics.Models.Data/Entities/SupportQueryStatus.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Data/Entities/SupportQueryType.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Data/Entities/SupportQuery.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Data/Entities/SupportQueryComment.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Data.EF/Config/SupportQueryStatusConfiguration.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Data.EF/Config/SupportQueryTypeConfiguration.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Data.EF/Config/SupportQueryConfiguration.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Data.EF/Config/SupportQueryCommentConfiguration.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Support/ContactUsRequestDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Support/AddCommentRequestDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Support/UpdateQueryRequestDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Support/SupportQueryListItemDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Support/SupportQueryDetailDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Support/SupportQueryCommentDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Support/SupportQueryCountsDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/ISupportQueryService.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Services/SupportQueryService.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/SupportQueryController.cs`
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Data.EF/RaceSyncDbContext.cs` — added 4 DbSets + 4 ApplyConfiguration calls
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IEmailService.cs` — added `SendAsync(string to, string subject, string body)`
  - `Runnatics.Api/Program.cs` — registered `ISupportQueryService → SupportQueryService`
- **Decisions made**:
  - SupportQuery/SupportQueryComment entities do NOT use AuditProperties owned type — these are support tickets with a simpler schema (CreatedAt/UpdatedAt directly on entity), as per explicit SQL spec
  - `AssignedToUserId = 0` in UpdateQueryRequestDto is treated as "unassign" (sets to null)
  - `LastUpdated` relative label is computed in service layer (days → hours → minutes)
  - `DeleteCommentAsync` is a hard delete (uses `repo.DeleteAsync(id)`) since comments have no AuditProperties
  - Admin user ID in AddComment is extracted from JWT `sub` claim in the controller
- **Pending**: IEmailService `SendAsync` implementation needs to be added to the concrete email service class

### 2026-04-16 — backend-agent — Public API: DTOs (Prompt 1)

- **What was built**: Public-facing DTO layer for the Runnatics marketing website
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicEventSummaryDto.cs` — summary card for event listings
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicEventDetailDto.cs` — extends summary; adds Races, FullDescription, Schedule, RouteMapUrl, RegistrationDeadline, ContactEmail
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicRaceCategoryDto.cs` — race info for public display; Price is null (Race entity has no Price column yet)
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicResultDto.cs` — race result with splits; GunTime/NetTime are TimeSpan? converted from milliseconds
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicSplitDto.cs` — checkpoint split time; CheckpointName from SplitTimes.ToCheckpoint.Name
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicGalleryImageDto.cs` — gallery image placeholder (no GalleryImage entity yet)
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicPagedResultDto.cs` — paged wrapper with TotalPages/HasNext/HasPrevious computed props
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Public/PublicContactRequestDto.cs` — contact form with DataAnnotations
- **Decisions made**:
  - `Event.Slug` exists — no workaround needed
  - `PagingList<T>` only has TotalCount (extends List<T>) — created new `PublicPagedResultDto<T>` with full pagination metadata
  - No encrypted IDs on public DTOs (plain int/slug — public data, no security concern)
  - `Race.Price` does not exist — property left nullable with comment; add column when ready
  - `PublicEventDetailDto` inherits `PublicEventSummaryDto` to avoid duplication
- **Pending**: Prompts 3–5 (controller, CORS, verify/build)

### 2026-04-16 — backend-agent — Public API: Service Methods (Prompt 2)

- **What was added**: New methods to existing service interfaces/implementations only (no new classes)
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IEventsService.cs` — added `GetPublicEventsAsync(bool isPast, string? city, string? searchQuery, int page, int pageSize)` and `GetPublicEventBySlugAsync(string slug)`; alias `DataPagingList` avoids collision with client `PagingList<T>`
  - `Runnatics.Services/EventsService.cs` — implemented both methods in `#region Public (no-auth) methods`; list uses filtered `.Include(e => e.Races)`, detail uses `.ThenInclude(r => r.Participants)` for per-race counts
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IResultsService.cs` — added `GetPublicResultsAsync(int eventId, string? raceName, string? searchQuery, string? gender, int page, int pageSize)` returning `DataResultsPagingList`
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsService.cs` — implemented `GetPublicResultsAsync`; filters by eventId, race name, bib/name search, gender; includes `Participant`, `Race`, `Participant.SplitTimes → ToCheckpoint`
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/ISupportQueryService.cs` — added `CreatePublicQueryAsync(string name, string email, string? phone, string subject, string message, string? eventName)`
  - `Runnatics.Services/SupportQueryService.cs` — implemented `CreatePublicQueryAsync`; embeds Name/Phone/EventName into the Body (no schema change needed)
- **Decisions made**:
  - All existing event search methods require `_userContext.TenantId` — unusable for public; new methods are tenant-agnostic
  - `GetEventById` requires encrypted ID + tenant scope — slug-based lookup is a new method
  - `GetLeaderboardAsync` returns admin leaderboard format — not suitable; new `GetPublicResultsAsync` is paged/filterable
  - `SubmitQueryAsync` only accepts Subject/Body/SubmitterEmail; `CreatePublicQueryAsync` packs Name/Phone/EventName into the Body string since `SupportQuery` has no separate columns for them
  - `EventOrganizer` has no email field → `ContactEmail` in `PublicEventDetailDto` will remain null
  - EF Core filtered includes (`.Where()` inside `.Include()`) used for Races and Participants to honour soft-delete
  - `DataPagingList` / `DataResultsPagingList` type aliases in interface files prevent CS0104 ambiguity with same-named types in Models.Client

### 2026-04-23 — backend-agent — Racetik API tasks (API-1 through API-11)

- **What was built**: 9 API tasks from the Racetik feature spec
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Events/EventSettings.cs` — removed `RemoveBanner`, `ShowResultSummaryForRaces`, `UseOldData`, `AllowParticipantEdit` from `EventSettingsRequest` (hardcoded server-side)
  - `Runnatics.Services/Mappings/AutoMapperMappingProfile.cs` — ignore the 4 removed EventSettings fields in mapper; ignore `BannerImage`/`BannerContentType` in `EventRequest → Event`; map `BannerImage → BannerBase64` in `Event → EventResponse`
  - `Runnatics.Services/EventsService.cs` — hardcode 4 fields to `false` in `CreateEventSettings`, `SaveEventAsync`, and `UpdateEventSettings`; add banner save on create; add banner existence check on update; update `GetPublicEventsAsync` to require `ConfirmedEvent = true` AND `Published = true`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Events/EventRequest.cs` — added `BannerBase64` property
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Events/EventResponse.cs` — added `BannerBase64` property
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Participants/ParticipantSearchReponse.cs` — added `IsEpcMapped` (bool)
  - `Runnatics.Services/ParticipantImportService.cs` — set `IsEpcMapped` in `PopulateCheckpointTimesAsync`; handle `DateOfBirth` in `UpdateParticipantExtendedAsync`; add `ManualCheckpointTimes` handling (creates SplitTimes records, sets `IsManualTiming = true`); added `ExportParticipantsAsync` (xlsx via ClosedXML)
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/Participant/UpdateParticipantRequest.cs` — added `DateOfBirth`, `ManualCheckpointTimes` (list of `ManualCheckpointTime`)
  - `Runnatics.Models.Data/Entities/Participant.cs` — added `IsManualTiming` (bool, default false)
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IParticipantImportService.cs` — added `ExportParticipantsAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/ParticipantsController.cs` — added `GET ~/api/races/{raceId}/participants/export`
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IBibMappingService.cs` — added `GetParticipantsWithMappingStatusAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services/BibMappingService.cs` — implemented `GetParticipantsWithMappingStatusAsync` (paginated, search by name/BIB, filter by mapped/unmapped)
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/BibMappingsController.cs` — added `GET /api/bib-mappings/participants` endpoint
  - `Runnatics.Services/RfidReaderService.cs` — added 500ms RSSI debounce: buffers reads per EPC, broadcasts best RSSI per EPC after window expires
  - `Runnatics.Services/Runnatics.Services.csproj` — added ClosedXML 0.102.3
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/BibMapping/GetEpcMappingRequest.cs` — pagination/filter request for EPC mapping
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/BibMapping/BibMappingParticipantResponse.cs` — paginated participant+mapping response
  - `db/scripts/Participants_AddIsManualTiming_20260423.sql` — ALTER TABLE for new `IsManualTiming` column
- **Decisions made**:
  - API-2 (location fields optional): Already done — all fields are `string?` with no `[Required]` in `EventRequest`
  - API-5 (participant search): Already working — `ParticipantImportService.Search` correctly applies all filters simultaneously
  - API-10 (EPC uniqueness + override): Already implemented in `BibMappingService.CreateAsync` with full conflict handling
  - `BannerImage` on the `Event` entity is the base64 storage field — `BannerBase64` in DTOs maps to it
  - Manual checkpoint times use SplitTimes entity; `SplitTimeMs` is relative to earliest known reading, or 0 if unknown
  - RSSI debounce is per-EPC (not per-window) — multiple EPCs in the same window are each deduplicated independently
- **Pending**: Run `db/scripts/Participants_AddIsManualTiming_20260423.sql` against Azure SQL

### 2026-04-17 — backend-agent — Bug Fixes (testing-feedback)

- **Bug #7 (Critical) — Bulk upload data loss**: Root cause was operator precedence bug in `ParticipantImportService.ProcessStagingDataAsync` line 258-266. `raceId.HasValue ? ... : true && IsActive && !IsDeleted` skipped soft-delete filters when raceId was provided, causing deleted participants' bibs to be treated as duplicates. Fix: `(!raceId.HasValue || p.RaceId == raceId.Value)`. Also: invalid staging records now marked "Invalid" (not left as "Pending"), and ProcessImportResponse.Errors list now populated with per-row details.
- **Bug #12 — Race category change response empty**: `UpdateParticipantExtendedAsync` returned `Task` (void), controller returned `{ }`. Changed return type to `Task<ParticipantSearchReponse?>`, added `MapToSearchResponse` helper, controller now returns full participant data (Bib, Name, Gender, Phone, Email, AgeCategory, Status).
- **Bug #11 — Export endpoint missing**: No export endpoint existed. Created `GET /api/results/{eventId}/{raceId}/export` on ResultsController. Returns CSV with: BibNumber, Name, Email, Mobile, Gender, AgeCategory, Status, GunTime, ChipTime, OverallRank, GenderRank, CategoryRank, plus dynamic columns for each checkpoint's split time. Added Email/Phone to LeaderboardEntry DTO and AutoMapper mapping.
- **Bug #1 — Event edit past dates**: No past-date validation exists in code. ValidateEventRequest only checks for null. No fix needed — issue likely elsewhere (frontend or DB constraint).
- **Bug #4 — Location fields optional**: Fields (VenueName, City, Country) are already `string?` without [Required]. No fix needed.
- **Bug #10 — Checkpoint clone**: Endpoint exists at `POST {eventId}/{sourceRaceId}/{destinationRaceId}/clone`. Service logic looks correct. Issue likely frontend-side (routing/params).
- **Files modified**: ParticipantImportService.cs, IParticipantImportService.cs, ParticipantsController.cs, ResultsController.cs, AutoMapperMappingProfile.cs, LeaderboardEntry.cs

### 2026-05-02 — backend-agent — Manual Time Entry with Race Recalculation

- **What was built**: `POST /api/RFID/{eventId}/{raceId}/participant/{participantId}/manual-time` — records a manual finish time for a participant, then recalculates the full race ranking
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Requests/RFID/ManualTimeRequest.cs` — `{ FinishTimeMs: long }` body DTO
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/RFID/ManualTimeResponse.cs` — returns updated rank, bib, formatted time, total finishers
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IResultsService.cs` — added `RecordManualTimeAsync(eventId, raceId, participantId, finishTimeMs)`
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsService.cs` — implemented `RecordManualTimeAsync`: upserts Results record (ManualFinishTimeMs + FinishTime/GunTime/NetTime), sets `Participant.IsManualTiming = true`, calls private `CalculateResultRankingsAsync` to re-rank ALL finishers in the race
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/RFIDController.cs` — injected `IResultsService`; added the POST endpoint
- **Decisions made**:
  - Upsert strategy: if a Results row exists (e.g., prior DNF), it is updated in-place; otherwise a new row is created — avoids wipeout of other participants' results
  - Only `CalculateResultRankingsAsync` is called (not the full `CalculateResultsAsync`), so existing RFID-derived finish times are preserved; rankings are simply recomputed across all Finished results
  - `Results.ManualFinishTimeMs` stores the raw admin entry; `FinishTime`/`GunTime`/`NetTime` are all set to the same value (no gun-to-chip offset available for manual entry)
  - `Participant.IsManualTiming = true` is set so the UI can distinguish chip vs. manual finishers

### 2026-05-05 — backend-agent — PublicController CLAUDE.md Compliance Fix

- **What was fixed**: Refactored `PublicController` to comply with all CLAUDE.md rules (Rule 2: thin controller only)
- **Violations removed**:
  - Entity `using` aliases (`Event`, `Results`) — controller no longer touches domain entities
  - All private mapping helpers (`MapToSummary`, `MapToDetail`, `MapToResultDto`, `GetBannerBase64`) — moved to service layer
  - In-memory year filter in `GetEvents` — moved to `GetPublicEventsAsync` as a DB-side filter
  - Multiple service calls per action (`GetEventResults`: 3 calls, `GetResultByBib`: 2 calls, `GetPublicStats`: 2 calls) — consolidated into single service calls
  - Business logic in controller (publish gate, DNF filter, bib match, stats arithmetic) — moved to service layer
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicStatsDto.cs` — new DTO for stats endpoint
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IEventsService.cs` — `GetPublicEventsAsync` now returns `PublicPagedResultDto<PublicEventSummaryDto>` + `year` param; `GetPublicEventBySlugAsync` returns `PublicEventDetailDto?`; added `GetPublicStatsAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services/EventsService.cs` — implemented updated signatures; added `MapToEventSummaryDto`, `MapToEventDetailDto`, `GetEventBannerBase64` private helpers; implemented `GetPublicStatsAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IPublicResultsService.cs` — removed `GetPublicResultsAsync` and `GetEffectivePublicLeaderboardSettingsAsync` (now private); added `GetPublicEventResultsAsync` and `GetPublicResultByBibAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services/PublicResultsService.cs` — `GetPublicResultsAsync` and `GetEffectivePublicLeaderboardSettingsAsync` made private; added `GetPublicEventResultsAsync`, `GetPublicResultByBibAsync`, `MapToResultDto` private static helper
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/PublicController.cs` — all actions now call exactly ONE service method; no entity types, no mapping, no business logic

### 2026-05-05 — backend-agent — SRP Refactoring of Public Results Changes

- **What was built**: Applied Single Responsibility Principle to the 2026-05-05 changes
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicGroupedLeaderboardDto.cs` — now contains only `PublicGroupedLeaderboardDto`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicParticipantDetailDto.cs` — now contains only `PublicParticipantDetailDto`
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IResultsService.cs` — removed 4 public no-auth methods (`GetPublicResultsAsync`, `GetEffectivePublicLeaderboardSettingsAsync`, `GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync`, `GetPublicParticipantDetailAsync`)
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsService.cs` — removed the same 4 methods; now admin-only
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/PublicController.cs` — now injects `IPublicResultsService` instead of `IResultsService`
  - `Runnatics.Api/Program.cs` — registered `IPublicResultsService → PublicResultsService`
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicGenderGroupDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicCategoryGroupDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicLeaderboardEntryDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicParticipantInfoDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicTimeDetailDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicSplitDetailDto.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IPublicResultsService.cs`
  - `Runnatics.Services/PublicResultsService.cs`
- **Decisions made**:
  - `IResultsService` is now admin-only; `IPublicResultsService` owns all anonymous public endpoints
  - `PublicResultsService` depends only on `IUnitOfWork`, `IEncryptionService`, `ILogger` — no `IMapper` or `IUserContextService` needed
  - One class per .cs file rule enforced across all 8 new DTO/service files

### 2026-05-05 — backend-agent — Public API Security (Rate Limiting + CORS + X-Public-Key)

- **What was built**: 3-layer security for `/api/public/*` endpoints
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Api/Program.cs` — rate limiting changed from global to per-IP partitioned (`AddPolicy<string>` with `RateLimitPartition.GetSlidingWindowLimiter`); `PublicRead` now 60 req/min per IP, `PublicWrite` now 5 req/10 min per IP; added inline `X-Public-Key` middleware that short-circuits with 401 for requests to `/api/public/*` missing or with wrong key
  - `Runnatics.Api/appsettings.json` — added `PublicApi:Key = "SET_IN_AZURE_ENV_VARS"` (real value must be set as Azure App Service environment variable)
- **CORS**: `PublicSite` policy was already correct (explicit `racetik.com`/`www.racetik.com` origins, no `AllowAnyOrigin`) — no changes needed
- **Decisions made**:
  - X-Public-Key middleware placed between `UseRouting()` and `UseCors()` so it fires before auth and before route matching overhead
  - Rate limiting uses `RateLimitPartition` keyed on `RemoteIpAddress` — each IP gets its own counter, not a shared global counter
- **Pending**:
  - Set `PublicApi__Key` environment variable in Azure App Service (override the placeholder)
  - UI: add `'X-Public-Key': import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_API_KEY` to the publicApi.ts fetch helper
  - UI: add `VITE_PUBLIC_API_KEY=` to the `.env.example` file (UI repo not present in this workspace)

### 2026-05-05 — backend-agent — Excel Export Fix + Public Leaderboard + Public Participant Detail

- **What was built**: 3 features — fixed admin Excel export (Task 1), added public grouped leaderboard endpoint (Task 2), added public participant detail endpoint (Task 3)
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsExportService.cs` — rewritten to bypass `GetLeaderboardAsync` entirely; now injects `RaceSyncDbContext` + `IEncryptionService` and queries Results directly (no leaderboard visibility gates). Builds 2-sheet Excel: "Overall Results" (all results with optional splits/pace columns from leaderboard settings) and "Category Results" (grouped by gender→category with merged group header rows)
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IResultsService.cs` — added `GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync` and `GetPublicParticipantDetailAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsService.cs` — implemented both new methods in `#region Public (no-auth) methods`
  - `Runnatics.Api/Controller/PublicController.cs` — added `GET api/public/{eventId}/{raceId}/leaderboard` and `GET api/public/participant/{participantId}`
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicGroupedLeaderboardDto.cs` — 4 DTOs: `PublicGroupedLeaderboardDto`, `PublicGenderGroupDto`, `PublicCategoryGroupDto`, `PublicLeaderboardEntryDto`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Public/PublicParticipantDetailDto.cs` — 4 DTOs: `PublicParticipantDetailDto`, `PublicParticipantInfoDto`, `PublicTimeDetailDto`, `PublicSplitDetailDto`
- **Decisions made**:
  - Excel export: bypasses leaderboard visibility pipeline entirely — admin always sees all results regardless of MaxDisplayedRecords/NumberOfResultsToShowOverall
  - Column control for export still honors leaderboard settings (ShowPace, ShowSplitTimes, ShowGenderResults, etc.)
  - Public grouped leaderboard: default shows top 3 per category (or `NumberOfResultsToShowCategory` from settings); `showAll=true` returns all
  - Participant detail URL format: `/p/{encryptedParticipantId}` built in service layer
  - `GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync` accepts encrypted IDs (same as admin endpoints)
  - `GetPublicParticipantDetailAsync` accepts encrypted participantId
  - `ResultsExportService` no longer depends on `IResultsService` — removed that dependency, replaced with `RaceSyncDbContext` + `IEncryptionService`

### 2026-05-10 — backend-agent — Race Notification System (Option B)

- **What was built**: Race SMS/Email notification layer using MSG91 (Flow API) + Mailer91 — separate from auth SMTP path
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Notifications/NotificationResult.cs` — result DTO with Ok/Fail factory methods
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/INotificationSmsService.cs` — checkpoint + completion SMS interface
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/INotificationEmailService.cs` — completion + support ticket email interface
  - `Runnatics.Services.Interface/IRaceNotificationService.cs` — orchestrator interface
  - `Runnatics.Services/Config/Msg91Config.cs` — bound to `Notification:Msg91` config section
  - `Runnatics.Services/Config/Mailer91Config.cs` — bound to `Notification:Mailer91` config section
  - `Runnatics.Services/Msg91NotificationSmsService.cs` — MSG91 Flow API; CompletionTemplateId = 69e08448cd4818fe270e6b32
  - `Runnatics.Services/Mailer91NotificationEmailService.cs` — Mailer91 HTTP API; RaceCompletion + SupportTicket HTML templates
  - `Runnatics.Services/RaceNotificationService.cs` — orchestrator; loads participant/result/query from DB; logs to NotificationLogs
  - `Runnatics.Models.Data/Entities/NotificationLog.cs` — append-only log entity (no AuditProperties)
  - `Runnatics.Data.EF/Config/NotificationLogConfiguration.cs` — Fluent API config
  - `db/scripts/NotificationLog_CreateTable_20260510.sql` — CREATE TABLE + index script
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Api/appsettings.json` — added `Notification:Msg91` and `Notification:Mailer91` sections (keys SET_IN_AZURE_ENV_VARS)
  - `Runnatics.Data.EF/RaceSyncDbContext.cs` — added `NotificationLogs` DbSet + `NotificationLogConfiguration` apply
  - `Runnatics.Api/Program.cs` — registered `IOptions<Msg91Config>`, `IOptions<Mailer91Config>`, `INotificationSmsService`, `INotificationEmailService`, `IRaceNotificationService` with typed HttpClients
  - `Runnatics.Services/SupportQueryService.cs` — injected `IRaceNotificationService`; replaced `SendSubmissionConfirmationAsync` (SMTP) with `NotifySupportTicketCreatedAsync` (Mailer91) in both `SubmitQueryAsync` and `CreatePublicQueryAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsService.cs` — injected `IRaceNotificationService`; fire-and-forget `NotifyRaceCompletionAsync` after `CalculateResultRankingsAsync` in `RecordManualTimeAsync`
  - `Runnatics.Services/OnlineTagIngestionService.cs` — injected `IRaceNotificationService`; fire-and-forget `NotifyCheckpointCrossingAsync` per unique participant after SignalR push in `PushLiveCrossingEvents`
- **Decisions made**:
  - `ISmsService` / `IEmailService` (auth SMTP path) completely untouched
  - Checkpoint notification dedup: `RaceNotificationService` queries `NotificationLogs` for a successful SMS to same participant+race within 30s before sending (matches the RFID dedup window)
  - All notification calls are fire-and-forget (`Task.Run`) to keep RFID webhook and manual time endpoints fast
  - `Participant.Phone` (not Mobile) is the phone field
  - `IGenericRepository<T>.GetQuery(filter)` is the correct method — not `GetQueryable()`
  - `SupportQueryService` still keeps `_emailService` (used for admin reply emails in `SendCommentEmailAsync`)
- **Pending**:
  - Run `db/scripts/NotificationLog_CreateTable_20260510.sql` against Azure SQL
  - Set `Notification__Msg91__AuthKey`, `Notification__Mailer91__ApiKey`, `Notification__Msg91__CheckpointTemplateId` in Azure App Service environment variables

### 2026-05-11 — backend-agent — Bug 8: Fix Split Times (SplitTime & CumulativeTime incorrect)

- **Root cause**: `PerformanceMetricsBuilder.ProcessSplitTime` fell back to `st.SplitTimeMs` (cumulative from gun start) when `st.SegmentTime == null`. For non-first checkpoints this produced the cumulative gun time instead of the segment interval, so 4.5km showed "00:14:28" (gun→4.5km) instead of "00:14:07" (start→4.5km). The UI then computed its own cumulative as a running sum of these wrong SplitTime values, giving "00:14:50".
- **Fix**: Added `previousSplitTimeMs` tracking in `BuildSplitTimesAndPerformance`; in `ProcessSplitTime`, when `SegmentTime == null`, derive segment as `SplitTimeMs[i] - SplitTimeMs[i-1]` (or `SplitTimeMs[0]` for the first row).
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Services/Helpers/PerformanceMetricsBuilder.cs` — added `previousSplitTimeMs` parameter to `ProcessSplitTime`; replaced single-line `st.SegmentTime ?? st.SplitTimeMs` fallback with three-branch derivation
- **Decisions made**:
  - The fix is display-layer only (no DB changes needed); `SplitTimeMs` (cumulative) and `SegmentTime` columns in `SplitTimes` table remain as-is
  - `CumulativeTime` computation (`SplitTimeMs[i] - startGunTimeMs`) was already correct — no change
  - Pace/speed for segments are now also computed from the correctly-derived `segmentTimeMs`

### 2026-05-11 — backend-agent — Bug 6: Show ALL raw RFID readings for participant detail

- **What was built**: `RawRfidTagReadings` on participant detail now returns ALL raw detections (not just 4 normalized) with enriched fields for IsNormalized, IsDuplicate, GunTime, NetTime, CheckpointDistance, and device name.
- **Files created**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Participants/RfidRawReadingDto.cs` — new DTO with Id, LocalTime, Date, Checkpoint, CheckpointDistance, Device, DeviceId, GunTime, NetTime, ChipId, ProcessResult, IsManual, IsDuplicate, IsNormalized
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsService.cs` — rewrote `LoadRawRfidReadingsAsync`: added `participantId` param, added `UploadBatch.ReaderDevice` include for friendly device name, ordered by `ReadTimeUtc`, built `normalizedByRawId` dictionary to resolve IsNormalized/GunTime/NetTime; now returns `List<RfidRawReadingDto>`
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Participants/ParticipantDetailsResponse.cs` — changed `RawRfidTagReadings` from `List<RawRfidTagReading>` to `List<RfidRawReadingDto>`
- **Decisions made**:
  - `RawRfidTagReading.cs` retained (not deleted) — legacy DTO kept to avoid breaking any other consumers
  - `RfidReadings` (normalized, List<RfidReadingDetail>) left untouched — UI can keep using it for the compact 4-row view; `RawRfidTagReadings` is the new full-detail source
  - `Device` field = `UploadBatch.ReaderDevice.Name` when available, fallback to `r.DeviceId` (MAC string)
  - `IsDuplicate` = `ProcessResult == "Duplicate" || DuplicateOfReadingId.HasValue` (belt-and-suspenders)
  - Readings without checkpoint assignment (94 unassigned) included; `Checkpoint`/`CheckpointDistance` are null for those rows
  - Ordering changed from `TimestampMs` to `ReadTimeUtc` for consistent chronological display

### 2026-05-11 — backend-agent — Bug 8 (Part 2): Fix SplitTime/CumulativeTime in Results.SplitTimeInfo

- **Root cause**: `GetParticipantSplitsAsync` in `ResultsService` set `SplitTime = FormatTime(SplitTimeMs)` — the cumulative gun-start time — instead of the segment interval. `Results.SplitTimeInfo` also had no `CumulativeTime` field.
- **Two separate `SplitTimeInfo` types exist in the codebase**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client.Responses.Participants.SplitTimeInfo` — used by participant detail (`PerformanceMetricsBuilder`, already fixed in earlier session)
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client.Responses.Results.SplitTimeInfo` — used by leaderboard/results (fixed in this session)
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Results/SplitTimeInfo.cs` — added `CumulativeTimeMs` (long) and `CumulativeTime` (string); added inline comments clarifying each field's meaning
  - `Runnatics.Services/Mappings/AutoMapperMappingProfile.cs` — added `Ignore()` for `CumulativeTimeMs` and `CumulativeTime`
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsService.cs` — rewrote `GetParticipantSplitsAsync` loop: `SplitTime` now uses `SegmentTime` (falls back to `SplitTimeMs` only when null); added `CumulativeTime` = start row uses its own `SplitTimeMs`, all others use `SplitTimeMs - startSplitTimeMs`
- **Decisions made**:
  - `SegmentTime` string field retained unchanged (same value as `SplitTime`) for backward compatibility
  - `SplitTimeMs` raw field retained so the UI can compute its own cumulative if needed

### 2026-05-11 — backend-agent — Fix Checkpoint Name "Unassigned" in RFID Raw Readings

- **Root cause**: `ReadingCheckpointAssignment` correctly links raw readings to checkpoints, but the assigned checkpoints are **child checkpoints** (IDs 287, 291, 293) with empty `Name`. The parent checkpoint (e.g., ID 267 "Finish") has the same `DistanceFromStart` but different `Device`. `LoadRawRfidReadingsAsync` displayed `"Unassigned"` because `cp.Name` was empty.
- **Fix**: Query all named checkpoints for the race keyed by `DistanceFromStart`, then resolve empty names at mapping time — if `cp.Name` is empty, look up the parent name from that dictionary. Format as `"Name (X km)"`.
- **Files modified**:
  - `Runnatics.Services/ResultsService.cs` — added `raceId` parameter to `LoadRawRfidReadingsAsync` (signature: `(chipEpc, participantId, raceId, eventId, eventTimeZone)`); added `namedByDistance` dictionary lookup; replaced `"Unassigned"` fallback with parent-name resolution; updated call site in `GetParticipantDetailsAsync` to pass `decryptedRaceId`
- **Decisions made**:
  - Parent name lookup uses `DistanceFromStart` as the key — avoids any device/ID coupling
  - Display format `"Name (X km)"` applied only when a name is resolved; null when truly unassigned
  - Query uses `AsNoTracking()` and filters `IsActive && !IsDeleted` on checkpoint rows

### 2026-05-15 — Testing Round 1 Bug Fixes (Session 1 — commit 43c005e)

Branch: `bugfix/testing-round-1`. Constraints: Do NOT execute SQL script, do NOT merge or push.

**BUG API-2 + API-11 (MultipleEPC + tag counts)**
- `RFIDImportService.ProcessRFIDImportAsync` Phase 1 and Phase 2 loops: skip readings with `IsMultipleEpc == true`
- `UploadRFIDFileEventLevelAsync`: removed duplicate FileHash check block; `TotalTagsInFile` = distinct non-MultipleEpc EPCs; `TagsProcessed = 0` initially, set to `successCount` at completion
- `UploadRFIDFileAsync`: added `batch.TagsProcessed = 0`
- `RfidRawReadingDto`: added `IsMultipleEpc` bool; set from `r.IsMultipleEpc` in `LoadRawRfidReadingsAsync`

**BUG API-3 (Manual time upsert fix)**
- `RecordManualTimeAsync`: split time computation now treats values < 86,400,000ms as elapsed ms from race start; larger values fall back to IST-from-midnight conversion (legacy)
- SplitTimes UPSERT: if no existing row, creates new; infers `FromCheckpointId` from checkpoint order (doesn't require pre-existing row)

**BUG API-6 (Race category change)**
- New `PUT /api/participants/{eventId}/{raceId}/{participantId}/race-category` endpoint
- `ChangeParticipantCategoryAsync` in ResultsService: updates `participant.AgeCategory`, triggers re-ranking
- `ChangeRaceCategoryRequest` DTO: `{ AgeCategory: string }`

**BUG API-7 (Process result)**
- New `POST /api/participants/{eventId}/{raceId}/{participantId}/process-result` endpoint
- `ProcessParticipantResultAsync` in ResultsService: validates participant exists, calls `ReprocessParticipantInternalAsync`
- `ReprocessParticipantInternalAsync`: touches result `UpdatedDate` to trigger DB recalculation, then calls `CalculateResultRankingsAsync`

**BUG API-8 + API-10 (Gender filter + race contamination)**
- `PublicResultsService.GetPublicResultsAsync` and `GetPublicGroupedLeaderboardAsync`: gender input normalized (M/Male→"M", F/Female→"F") before DB filter
- Race name filter changed from `Contains` to exact `==` match to prevent cross-race results leaking
- `MapToResultDto`: gender displayed as "Male"/"Female" (from stored "M"/"F")

**BUG API-9 (IsTimed gate)**
- `ProcessRFIDImportAsync`: checks `Race.IsTimed` before doing any EPC-to-participant mapping; returns `Status = "Skipped"` when false

**BUG API-13 (Dashboard stats)**
- New `GET /api/dashboard/event/{eventId}/stats` → `EventDashboardStatsDto` (gender/category/race breakdowns)
- New `GET /api/dashboard/race/{eventId}/{raceId}/stats` → `RaceDashboardStatsDto` (gender/category, fastest/avg times)
- `EventDashboardStatsDto`, `RaceDashboardStatsDto`, `GenderBreakdownItem`, `CategoryBreakdownItem`, `RaceStatItem` created in `Runnatics.Models.Client/Responses/Dashboard/EventDashboardStatsDto.cs`

**SQL Script** (not executed): `db/scripts/TestingFeedback_Round1_SchemaChanges_20260515.sql`
- Adds: `ManualDistance` (Checkpoints), `IsMandatory` (Checkpoints), `IsTimed` (Races), `IsMultipleEpc` (RawRFIDReading), `TotalTagsInFile`/`TagsProcessed` (UploadBatch)
- Drops duplicate FileHash unique index; adds performance indexes

---

### 2026-05-15 — Testing Round 1 Bug Fixes (Session 2 — commit 8b25f20)

Branch: `bugfix/testing-round-1`.

**BUG API-5 (Split time correctness + IsMandatory status + gender rankings)**
- `CalculateSplitTimesAsync`: added `previousCheckpointId` tracking; set `ToCheckpointId`, `FromCheckpointId`, `SplitTime` (TimeSpan) on new SplitTimes records — these were all missing (required fields defaulting to 0); skip readings with null/zero GunTime
- `CalculateResultsAsync`: replaced "highest distance checkpoint = finish" logic with IsMandatory-based status:
  - All mandatory checkpoints covered → "Finished" (finish time from mandatory checkpoint with highest distance)
  - Some mandatory covered → "DNF"
  - No mandatory covered → "DNS"
  - Falls back to single highest-distance checkpoint if no IsMandatory checkpoints are flagged
- `CalculateSplitTimeRankingsAsync` and `CalculateResultRankingsAsync`: fixed gender filter from `"Male"/"Female"/"Others"` to `"M"/"F"` — gender is stored as single character via ValueConverter
- `ResultStatus` constants class created at `Runnatics.Models.Data/Constants/ResultStatus.cs`

**BUG API-14 (Performance hardening)**
- Azure SQL retry: already configured (`maxRetryCount: 5`, `maxRetryDelay: 10s`) — no change needed
- Added Brotli + Gzip response compression (`CompressionLevel.Fastest`, `EnableForHttps = true`)
- Added `AddOutputCache` with `"PublicResults"` policy (30s TTL, tag `"public-results"`)
- `[OutputCache(PolicyName = "PublicResults")]` added to 5 GET public endpoints: `GetEventById`, `GetResultByBib`, `GetResultFilters`, `GetRaceFilters`, `GetBracketFilters`
- Cache evicted with `IOutputCacheStore.EvictByTagAsync("public-results")` in `EventsController.Update` when `request.EventSettings.Published == true`

## 2026-06-20 — Durable manual-time overrides (raw / override / derived three-layer model)

**Problem:** Manual time edits only lived in `ReadNormalized`, which `ClearProcessedDataAsync` always deletes → every manual correction was wiped by clear+reprocess.

**Fix (all-in-one, API):**
- **New table `ManualTimeOverrides`** (`db/scripts/Add_ManualTimeOverride_20260620.sql`, idempotent, run manually) — durable authoritative input; no clear query touches it. Filtered unique index `(ParticipantId, CheckpointId) WHERE IsDeleted=0`.
- **Entity + config** `ManualTimeOverride` / `ManualTimeOverrideConfiguration`; registered in `RaceSyncDbContext`.
- **Write path** `ResultsService.RecordManualTimeAsync` STEP A-1: upsert the durable override (the single active row) alongside the existing `ReadNormalized` display write. `ManualCrossingUtc` = IST→UTC via `Event.TimeZone`.
- **Phase 2.4** `RFIDImportService.ApplyManualOverridesAsync` — runs in `ProcessCompleteWorkflowAsync` after Phase 2 (normalize), before Phase 2.5 (splits). Upserts `ReadNormalized` for each active override (ChipTime/GunTime/NetTime, IsManualEntry=true). Covers reprocess + clear+reprocess + race move (all funnel through this workflow). NoTracking-safe: load-once + UpdateRange/BulkInsert.
- **Revert** `ResultsService.RemoveManualTimeAsync` + `DELETE .../participant/{id}/manual-time?checkpointId=` on RFIDController — soft-deletes override + manual ReadNormalized/SplitTimes, recomputes status (mandatory per-distance gates), re-ranks. Releases the filtered unique slot so re-override works. May flip Finished→DNF if manual-only.
- **Move-invalidation** `ParticipantImportService.MoveParticipantToRaceAsync` step 3b — soft-deletes the participant's overrides (source-race CheckpointId is meaningless in the target).
- **Docs** `context/manual-overrides.md` (three-layer invariant) + CONTEXT.md router line.

**Staged UI (blocked on auth):** "Remove manual time" button must warn when the checkpoint has no underlying raw read (runner may become DNF). Endpoint doesn't block; UI warns.

**Build**: 0 errors, pre-existing warnings only. SQL to be run manually by Kunal; test matrix on race 47 (set → reprocess persists; clear+reprocess survives; revert; re-override after revert; move invalidates).
